            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <hi>WHEN in the Preface to the Synod of</hi> Diamper, <hi>I promiſed, from</hi> Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe Relations, <hi>to give ſome Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Churches which were never within the Bounds of the</hi> Roman Empire; <hi>I intended to have begun with the Church of</hi> Moſul, <hi>or</hi> Babylon; <hi>but not having hitherto been able to procure thoſe Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of it which I had then ſome reaſon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect; and having, during my nine Years Reſidence at</hi> Lisbon, <hi>furniſhed my ſelf with all the</hi> Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe <hi>Books which do any ways treat of</hi> Ethiopia, <hi>I was perſwaded by ſome Friends to alter my mind, and to begin with</hi> That Church, <hi>which of all others, till within theſe Two hundred years, had had the leaſt Communication with the</hi> Roman; <hi>and which, notwithſtanding all the pains its Princes and the Jeſuits have been at of late, to bring her under the Bondage of the Papacy, has, tho with a terrible ſtruggle, maintained her Primitive Liberty and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency on</hi> that Ambitious <hi>and</hi> Uſurping See; <hi>and does to this day, with greater Zeal than ever, aſſert them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And that I may not ſeem</hi> Actum agere <hi>in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing an Hiſtory of</hi> Ethiopia <hi>after the Learned Mr.</hi> Ludolphus: <hi>I am to acquaint the Reader, That whereas the two great Splendid</hi> Roman Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions <hi>into that Empire, are the moſt remarkable things that have come to our knowledge in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of that Church; ſo if ſome of my Learned Friends are not miſtaken, Thoſe Two Miſſions, with
<pb facs="tcp:57883:4"/>all their Steps and Circumſtances, are here placed in a truer Light than they were ever ſeen in before.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And tho I will not promiſe that my</hi> Conjectures <hi>upon the dark and hidden things of thoſe</hi> Miſſions <hi>are all true; as who indeed that makes many, and eſpecially in matters which have been induſtriouſly diſguiſed by men of Art, will venture to promiſe? yet this I can ſafely ſay, that I have not made one but what I thought I had ſome ground for; And as to</hi> matters of fact, <hi>I do aſſure the Reader, that in the matter of the</hi> Miſſions, <hi>I have ſet down few or none, but what I had out of</hi> Roman-Catholick Writers, <hi>and licenſed by the</hi> Inquiſition, <hi>and who for the moſt part were</hi> Jeſuits.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There are</hi> Four things, <hi>whereof, if I am not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, this Hiſtory will abundantly ſatisfy the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Reader.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Firſt <hi>is, That the</hi> Roman Miſſionaries, <hi>but eſpecially the</hi> Jeſuits, <hi>having neither the gift of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, nor of Patience, to wait for the ſlow iſſues of the old method of converting Nations by preaching the Faith to them, are every where (where they can come at them) for diſpatching it with</hi> Dragoons, <hi>or by ſome other violent and ſanguinary way. The</hi> Jeſuits <hi>being all to a man of the ſame opinion with their great Apoſtle of the</hi> Indies, Francis Xaveir, <hi>whoſe Maxim, as</hi> Ravarette <hi>informs us, was:</hi> Mientras no eſtiuveron debaxo del Moſquete, no avia de ver Chriſtiano de provecho; <hi>that is to ſay,</hi> Miſſionaries without Muskets do never make Converts to any purpoſe: <hi>The truth of which Maxim,</hi> John Bolunte, <hi>a Miſſionary Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, tells us, is confirmed by univerſal Experience.</hi> Ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Second <hi>is, That there is no Tyranny in the World equal to that which the</hi> Roman Prelates <hi>(where they have the Secular Arm at their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand) do continually exerciſe, and that without the common relentings of humanity, upon all ſorts of people, that will not turn to their Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Third <hi>is, That</hi> Miſſionaries, <hi>when ever they have inſpired a Prince, the main Body of whoſe Subjects are Anti-papiſts, with a bigotry to introduce their Religion into his Country, do commonly before they have done with him, either run him out of breath, or make him run his head againſt a wall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Fourth <hi>is, That</hi> Ambition <hi>did very early take poſſeſſion of the</hi> Jeſuits Order, <hi>that</hi> Society <hi>not being above ten years ſtanding in the World, when it had engroſſed a Miſſion to it ſelf, which did promiſe both greater and cheaper Honours to its Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters than ever any</hi> Miſſion <hi>had done before.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The clear diſcovery of which Truths, together with that of the true Spirit and Temper of</hi> Miſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, <hi>and the Precipices they put Princes upon, who are ſo unhappy as to be their Converts, muſt make</hi> This Hiſtory <hi>to be of ſome uſe to all</hi> Proteſtant <hi>Countreys, which may therein, as in a glaſs ſee, what treatment they are to expect from Popery, when ever the Supream Power is in its hands.</hi>

               <hi>Branti;</hi> after this it runs directly Eaſt, till it enters the great Lake of <hi>Dembea,</hi> which is about 20 Leagues diſtant from its Head in a right Line; and without intermixing its water with thoſe of the Lake, runs into the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel it hath opened to it ſelf on the North ſide of it.</p>
            <p>This Lake,

               </note> which the <hi>Habaſſins</hi> call the Sea of <hi>Dembea,</hi> lieth in the Latitude of 13 Degrees and a half, and on its South-ſhore is about 20 Leagues in length, and on its North 35, not reckoning its windings, which make it a great deal more; near its middle, and where it is deepeſt, it may be about 10 or 12 Leagues over: Its Waters are very clear and wholſom; it abounds with Fiſh of all ſorts, and has great herds of Sea-Horſes, which come aſhore daily and graze on the Plains; but for Snakes and Crockodiles it is as free from them, as it is from <hi>Tritans</hi> and <hi>Mermaids,</hi> by which it has been reported to be inhabited.</p>
            <p>Divers great Rivers beſide the <hi>Nile</hi> diſcharge themſelves into this Lake, which is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Receptacle of all the Prodigious Flouds of Rain which in the Winter Months do tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble down from the high Mountains of <hi>Dem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bea;</hi> and this Lake having no other ſource for this vaſt body of Water but the Channel of the <hi>Nile,</hi> it makes bold with that, and thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth its Stream prodigiouſly.</p>
            <p>The Lake of <hi>Dembea</hi> is adorned with One and twenty Iſlands,
<note place="margin">Iſlands in the Lake of <hi>Dembea.</hi>
               </note> ſome of which are pretty large, namely that of <hi>Dek,</hi> which contains as much Arable Land as 40 Yoke of Oxen can plough; there are ſeveral Monaſteries in ſeven

            <p>The cauſe of the riſing and falling of the <hi>Thames</hi> at <hi>Oxford,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The true Cauſe of the riſing of <hi>Nile.</hi>
               </note> is not more certainly known, than that of the <hi>Nile</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> is now; for the Winter in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> which is one continued Storm of Rain, being in the Months of <hi>June, July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt,</hi> by ſending a vaſt body of water into the Lake of <hi>Dembea,</hi> which has no other vent for its Waters than the Channel of the <hi>Nile,</hi> doth ſwell that River to a prodigious heighth, all which Torrent of water being kept together by ſteep Mountains on both ſides, until it comes down into <hi>Egypt,</hi> which is a flat open Countrey; it there expands it ſelf, impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Land thereof with its Mud, which was hindred from ſubſiding before by the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable rapidity of that River, while it was pent in on all ſides by high Mountains.</p>
            <p>This is the true Cauſe of the riſing of the <hi>Nile;</hi> which though the world would not,
<note place="margin">It was known by the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents. <hi>Strab. lib.</hi> 15. <hi>Plin. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 9.</note> it ſeems, believe, was told by <hi>Nearchus, Pliny, Strabo,</hi> and others; neither is their calling them the Summer-Rains any Argument at all of thoſe Learned Men having been ignorant
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57883:16"/>of the time of the Year when they fell, but rather the contrary; for notwithſtanding the <hi>Habaſſins</hi> upon the account of thoſe great Rains do reckon <hi>June, July,</hi> and <hi>Auguſt,</hi> their Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Months, yet in <hi>Egypt</hi> and all other Places without the <hi>Northern Tropick,</hi> they are reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Summer.</p>

               <p>What is known from Hiſtory of the firſt Introduction of Chriſtianity into <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> is, That in the beginning of the Fourth Century, one <hi>Meropius,</hi> a Chriſtian Philoſopher, going into <hi>India</hi> with Two of his Scholars, whoſe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57883:18"/>Names were <hi>Frumentius</hi> and <hi>Aedeſius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Frumentius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Axum,</hi> was the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of <hi>Ethiopia.</hi>
                  </note> had the misfortune to touch on the Coaſt of <hi>Ethiopia;</hi> where <hi>Meropius</hi> was inhumanly Murthered by the Natives, but his Two Scholars having their Lives ſpared, and being found to be Youths of fine Parts, as well as Beauty, they were carried to Court, where <hi>Frumentius</hi> was put into the Secretaries Office, and <hi>Aedeſius</hi> into the Buttery.</p>
               <p>When the Emperor, who had always been very kind to them, came to Die, he gave them both their Liberty; but as they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring to make uſe of it and return home, the Queen Regent was importunate with them to ſtay, and to undertake the Tutelage of her Son till he was of Age, which they having conſented to, did during that time, write to all the <hi>Roman</hi> Merchants reſiding in the ports of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> that were Chriſtians, to aſſemble together to Worſhip God, as they themſelves, and the Converts they had made at Court, did Daily.</p>
               <p>When their Pupil came to take the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Government upon himſelf, they both deſired Leave to return home, which having obtained with great difficulty, they left <hi>Ethiopia; Aedeſius</hi> went to <hi>Tire</hi> to live with his Relations; but <hi>Frumentius</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a greater love for his Religion, repaired directly to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> with an intention to acquaint the Biſhop thereof, who at that time was the Great <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> with the footing Chriſtianity had taken in <hi>Ethiopia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>St. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> who was overjoyed at this good news, having conſulted with his Clergy
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57883:18"/>what was fit to be done, perſuaded <hi>Frumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> whom he obſerved to be a Perſon of great Zeal and Piety, to be Conſecrated a Biſhop by him, and to return into <hi>Ethiopia</hi> with that Character, to accompliſh a Work he had ſo happily begun; and accordingly he was Conſecrated a Biſhop by St. <hi>Athanaſius;</hi> and going back to <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> did in a ſhort time Convert both the Emperor and the main Body of his People to the Chriſtian Faith.</p>
               <p>This Account of the Introduction of Chriſtianity into <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> is to be met with in the 9th. Chapter of the 1ſt. Book of <hi>Ruffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> who ſaith he had not this Story from the chat of the People, but from <hi>Aedeſius</hi>'s own mouth, who was Ordained a Presbyter at <hi>Tire.</hi>

               <p>And as <hi>Frumentius</hi> was undoubtedly Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox as to the Doctrine of our Lord's Divinity when he was Conſecrated a Biſhop by St. <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius;</hi> ſo the World coming afterwards to complain of its being turned <hi>Arian,</hi> could not ſhake his Conſtancy in the True Faith, as appears from <hi>Conſtantius</hi>'s Letters to the Princes of <hi>Axum,</hi> whoſe Names were <hi>Abra</hi> and <hi>Azba;</hi> which Letter I ſhall here ſet down as I find it in St. <hi>Athanaſius</hi>'s Apology to that Emperor.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>In caſe</hi> Frumentius <hi>ſhould yield a ready obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and give a full account of the whole Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, ſo that it ſhall be certified that he does not diſſent from the Eccleſiaſtical Laws, and the Faith that is now eſtabliſhed, and it doth appear that he is a Perſon of a Good Life, he may then be ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Biſhop; which at preſent he is not of Right.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Whereas if he ſhall ſeek delays, and decline coming to Judgment, that will be an undeniable Proof of his having been ſeduced by the words of the moſt Profligate</hi> Athanaſius; <hi>as alſo of his acting impiouſly againſt God, and of his being involved in the ſame Crimes whereof</hi> Athanaſius <hi>ſtands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed: In which caſe if he ſhould be ſuffered to go on without controul, as he will do all that he can to corrupt your People with his Wicked and Impious Words, and not only diſturb and deſtroy the Church, and belch out Blaſphemies againſt the Supreme God;

               <p>But as it is certain that no ſuch ſplendid <hi>Ethiopick</hi> Embaſſy ever came to <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo it is as certain, that it was never ſo much as thought of in <hi>Habaſſia;</hi> on the contrary, <hi>Zera Jacob,</hi> when he was ſolicited by ſome <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>

               <p>But it is no matter whether it was a Fiction
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57883:27"/>or a Reality, ſo long as it furniſhed a good pretence, for a preſent turn, and tended to the Diſparagement of the Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> which, together with the ground it ſtood upon, was blown up purely by Tricks of this nature; <hi>the Yoke</hi> the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> had laid on the Neck of the <hi>Papacy,</hi> being broke by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, of the <hi>Greek</hi> and all other Churches and Patriarchs having ſubmitted themſelves to it.</p>
               <p>This is all that I have been able to meet with in <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latin</hi> Hiſtory concerning the Church of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> before the Year 1490, when it was firſt diſcovered by the <hi>Portugueſes.</hi> And as for Hiſtories of their own, I do not find they have any, beſides ſome Fabulous Legends of the Lives of their Monks; of which I ſhall only give the Reader a Taſte.</p>
               <p>In the Life of <hi>Tecla Haymanot,</hi> the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous of all their Monks both for Piety and Miracles, the following Account of the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of their Grand Abbots is given.</p>
               <p>The Angel St. <hi>Michael</hi> gave the Cowl to St. <hi>Anthony;</hi> St. <hi>Anthony</hi> gave it to St. <hi>Macari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us; Macarius</hi> gave it to <hi>Pachomius; Pachomius</hi> to Abbot <hi>Araguni,</hi> or <hi>Michael,</hi> who was one of the Nine Monks that came into <hi>Ethiopia; Araguni</hi> gave it to <hi>Bazana; Bazana</hi> to <hi>Maz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralmoa; Mazralmoa</hi> to Abbot <hi>John; John</hi> to Abbot <hi>Jeſus; Jeſus</hi> to <hi>Tecla Haymanot,</hi> to whom Chriſt appeared, and promiſed, that whoſoever ſhould kill a Serpent upon a <hi>Friday,</hi> ſhould be pardoned all the Sins he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in Forty Years.</p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:57883:28"/>
               <p>But notwithſtanding the Lives of the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſin</hi> Monks are all of a piece with the Lives of all the other Monks that are extant, that is, extreamly fabulous; yet this muſt be ſaid for them, that Monkery continues to this day much the ſame among them, as it was in the beginning, from which in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it is ſo ſtrangely degenerated.</p>
               <p>For in <hi>Habaſſia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Monkery much the ſame in <hi>Habaſſia,</hi> as it was in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</note> any one that has a mind to be a Monk, retires thereupon to the Deſart, where he puts on what Habit he pleaſeth, or judgeth to be moſt ſutable to his pretenſions. Their Obligation ſo long as they profeſs themſelves Monks, which they are always at their liberty to give over, is to faſt every day in the Year till three a Clock in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, and to Aſſemble together at Midnight, and at other certain Hours to perform their Devotions; they do generally exerciſe great Auſterities upon themſelves, being very ſtrict in their Faſts, many of them eating but once in two days, and ſome never but upon <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days;</hi> ſome of them are ſaid to have made Holes in the Trunks of Trees, and to have lodged in them till the Trees have grown to ſhut them in.</p>
               <p>Their Monaſtries are more like Villages than <hi>Roman</hi> Convents,
<note place="margin">Their Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtries are little Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages.</note> every Monk having his diſtinct dwelling Houſe with as much Land laid to it, as a Man is able to cultivate, and when they come to dye they diſpoſe of their Goods as they pleaſe, only the Land re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains ſtill to the Monaſtries. Now this courſe falls in exactly with that of the Primitive Monks, who always lived in Deſerts, where
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57883:28"/>they work'd hard, and were under no Vows; whereas the <hi>Roman</hi> Monks have their Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtries in or near Princes Courts, and in all Populous Cities; and tho generally hurried into that Profeſſion, either by their Parents, or by ſome ſudden fit of Melancholy, are fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in it by Vows for their Lives, and are ſo far from putting their Hand to any work, that they are every where become proverbial for Lazineſs; and as for their Buildings, they are much more like Palaces than the Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of People that have renounced the World, and taken a Vow of Poverty upon them.</p>
               <p>The moſt famous of all their Monaſtries, is that of <hi>Alelujah,</hi> wherein formerly there are ſaid to have been 40000 Monks together, all the Country about having been given to the Monks thereof to cultivate.</p>
               <p>I do not find that any ſort of Learning did ever flouriſh among the <hi>Habaſſins,</hi> ſo that they have but few Books beſides the Bible, the Canons of the firſt Councils, the Homilies of the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers, and the Lives of their Saints.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Habaſſins</hi> do hold the Scriptures to be the perfect Rule of the Chriſtian Faith,
<note place="margin">The <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſins</hi> hold the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Rule of Faith.</note> inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that they deny it to be in the Power of a General Council to oblige People to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any thing as an Article of Faith, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an expreſs warrant from thence.</p>
               <p>Their Canon of Scripture conſiſts of 85 Books; the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> conſiſting of 46, and the <hi>New</hi> of 39.</p>

               <p>They allow the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the firſt Patriarch,

                  </note> They do not believe <hi>Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> as is plain from their Liturgy, in which the Words of Inſtitution are thus ſet down, <hi>This Bread is my Body, this Cup is my Blood,</hi> which Propoſitions the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> themſelves acknowledge cannot be underſtood otherwiſe than ſiguratively.</p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:57883:30"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ludolphus</hi> farther tells us, That when he asked <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>Habaſſin,</hi> Whether he did not think that the Subſtance of the Bread and Wine was changed and converted into the Subſtance of the Body and Blood of Chriſt? That he made anſwer, That no ſuch ſort of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> was known or underſtood by his Countreymen, who were not ſo ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous, neither did they uſe to ſtart ſuch thorny Queſtions. Nevertheleſs it ſeemed to him probable and likely, That the Common Bread and Wine was changed into the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Repreſentation of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo was altered from Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane to Sacred, to repreſent the true Body and Blood of Chriſt to the Communicants. Than which Declaration, nothing can be more agreeable to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> concerning the Euchariſt. Finally, <hi>Paul de Roo,</hi> Secretary to the <hi>Dutch Eaſt-India</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, was in the Year 1691. told by the <hi>Habaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin</hi> Ambaſſador, who was ſent to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of <hi>Batavia, That</hi> Tranſubſtantiation <hi>and the Adoration of the Conſecrated Bread in the Sacrament, were what the</hi> Habaſſins <hi>abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi>

I was much troubled at</hi> Matthew<hi>'s Death, who dyed in the Monaſtery of</hi> Baſayn, <hi>within my Dominions, as he was returning home; he was not ſent by me, for I was then but a Boy of</hi> 11 <hi>years of Age, and had not taken the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon me after my Father's death, but by Queen</hi> Helena, <hi>whom I reverenced as my Mother, and who at that time adminiſtred the Affairs of the Empire.</hi> Matthew <hi>was by Profeſſion a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, and his true name was</hi> Abraham, <hi>which he changed, that he might travel thorow the</hi> Turkiſh <hi>Dominions with the more ſecurity.</hi>

The General of your Army, after he had reſcued him out of the hands of the Enemy, took care to convey him to your Court; at which, as</hi> Matthew <hi>was punctual in acquainting you with all that he had in Commiſſion to ſay, ſo he was the ſame in ſending me word how honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably he was entertained by you, and how you had loaded him with Gifts; all which was confirmed by your Ambaſſadors, who were conveyed hither by</hi> Didacus Lopez de Segueiea, <hi>the Admiral of your Fleet; and by the Letters which were to have been delivered to me by</hi> Edward Golvam, <hi>who died in the Iſland of</hi> Camera, <hi>and were delivered by the ſurviving Ambaſſadors. I rejoyced exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly at the ſight of your Letters, and did return thanks to God for them.

But the thing that affected me with the moſt devotion, was the Story your Ambaſſadors told me, of</hi> Ethiopia <hi>having been firſt diſcovered to your Fleet by a Miracle: Which after it had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven over all hopes of finding it, was conducted to one of our Ports by a Red Croſs that appeared one morning in the Heavens; as this appears to me to have been a Miracle, ſo undoubtedly the Admiral of your Fleet, who had ſuch an extraordinary ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour done to him, muſt be exceedingly beloved of God.</hi>

But while I was full of this Joy, before I had ſent any Ambaſſador to him, I received the News of your and my Father's Death, which turned my Joy ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly into Sorrow, whereof our Court, Prelates, and Monks, and, in a word, all our Faithful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, did deeply partake: Our Sorrow upon this News becoming equal to our former Joy.</hi>

                        <hi>Sir, From the beginning of my Reign there was no Ambaſſador nor Envoy ſent to me by the King or Kingdom of</hi> Portugal, <hi>but by your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who ſent ſome of his Captains hither, and with them ſome of his Nobles, and Clarks, and Deacons, who brought with them all the Utenſils of a Solemn Maſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I muſt tell you, I was overjoyed at their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, and did receive them with great Affection, diſmiſſing them after they had done their Buſineſs, that ſo they might return home in Peace and with Honour: But being come to the Port of the</hi> Red-Sea <hi>that is on my Borders, they found the Admiral of their Fleet gone; who, as he certified me him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, could wait no longer for them, by reaſon of a Cuſtom that you have, of changing your Admiral every Third Year, which, together with no other Fleets having touched at any of my Ports for ſome Years after, was the cauſe of your Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador's
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57883:43"/>having ſtaid ſo long at my Court.</hi>

                        <hi>I do now ſend, what I deſire of you, by Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Chriſtopher Licanot, <hi>whoſe Baptiſmal Name is</hi> Zaga Zabo, <hi>that is to ſay,</hi> The Grace of the Father, <hi>who will lay my Demands before you.

                     <p>
                        <hi>O Lord my Brother King, attend and apply your ſelf to the Friendſhip that was begun betwixt us by your Father, and do not neglect to ſend Letters and Ambaſſadors to us frequently; for I am extremely deſirous to receive them from you, as from my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And ſince we are both Chriſtians, and the</hi> Mahometans, <hi>though Wicked, are ſtill in Peace with all of their own Sect, it is fit it ſhould be the ſame betwixt us. And I do declare, That for the future I will receive no Embaſſy from the King of</hi> Egypt, <hi>nor from any of thoſe Kingdoms, which have formerly ſent Ambaſſadors to us, nor from no other King but only from your Highneſs, from whom I do earneſtly deſire to have them come; for the</hi> Mahometan <hi>Kings, by reaſon of the difference that is betwixt us in Religion, do never look upon me as their Friend, and do only pretend to have a Kindneſs for me, that they may Trade with the more conveniency and ſecurity within my Dominions, from whence they draw great Profit, exporting Yearly great Quantities of Gold, whereof they are extremely Covetons, while at the ſame time they have no real Friendſhip for me, for which reaſon I take no pleaſure in their Gain; but this having been a Cuſtom of my Anceſtors, was to be endured; though after all, the only thing that hinders me from making War upon them, and Confounding
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57883:43"/>them, is the fear of provoking them thereby to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and deſtroy the Temple of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>where the Sepulchre of Chriſt is, which God hath been pleaſed to leave in the hands of thoſe filthy</hi> Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans, <hi>and to demoliſh the Churches that are in</hi> Egypt <hi>and</hi> Syria; <hi>this is the only cauſe why I do not Invade and Conquer them, which I am ſorry I am not at liberty to do.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>O King, I can by no means rejoyce in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Kings of</hi> Europe, <hi>who, as I am informed, do not agree in one heart, but are at War one with another; be you all Unanimous, and in Friendſhip one with another; for my own part, had I a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian King in my Neighbourhood, I would never be abſent from him. I do not know what to ſay of theſe matters, nor what to do, ſince God ſeems to have ordained things to be as they are.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>My Lord, let me have Ambaſſadors from you frequently; for when I ſee your Letters I think I behold your face; there being a greater Friendſhip betwixt thoſe that live far aſunder, than betwixt Neighbours, by reaſon of the ſtronger deſire they have one for another; for he that has hid his Treaſure thinks the oftner of it, and loves it the more for not ſeeing it, according to what Chriſt ſaith in his Goſpel,</hi> Where your treaſure is there will your hearts be alſo; <hi>my heart is therefore with you, becauſe you are my Treaſure, and you ought alſo to make me your Treaſure, ſo as ſincerely to joyn your Heart with ours.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>O Lord and Brother, obſerve this word, for I am told you are very Wiſe, and in Wiſdom like your Father, of which, when I was informed, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned Thanks to God for it, and throwing away Sorrow, did put on Joy, and ſaid, Bleſſed be

                     <p>
                        <hi>Sir, Have a care you do not grow weary, ſince you are no leſs Valiant than your Father, and do not diſcover your ſelf to be Weak againſt the</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans <hi>and</hi> Gentiles, <hi>whom, with God's Aſſiſtance, you may eaſily Conquer; and have a care how you ſay, The Forces left me by my Father are ſmall; for they are abundantly ſufficient, and God will always help you: I have</hi> Men, Gold, <hi>and</hi> Proviſions, <hi>like the</hi> Sand of the Sea, <hi>and the</hi> Stars of Heaven; <hi>ſo that we two being United, may with eaſe deſtroy the whole Barbarous Race of</hi> Mahometans; <hi>I deſire nothing of you, but Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Officers to Diſcipline and Command my Soldiers.</hi>

Hearken to me, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Lord; for there is one thing I muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of you, which is, That you would ſend me ſome of your</hi> Learned Men, <hi>as alſo ſome</hi> Artificers, <hi>that underſtand how to make</hi> Images, <hi>and how to</hi> Print Books, <hi>and to make</hi> Swords, <hi>and all ſorts of</hi> Military Weapons, <hi>with ſome</hi> Maſons, Carpenters, <hi>and</hi> Phyſicians <hi>and</hi> Surgeons, <hi>and ſome

Your</hi> Holineſs <hi>is not ignorant of the Goſpel-Commands, and of its having ſaid,</hi> A kingdom divided againſt it ſelf cannot ſtand, but will become deſolate. <hi>For if thoſe Kings would but all join together, they would quickly deſtroy all the</hi> Mahometans, <hi>and with eaſe demoliſh the</hi> Sepulchre <hi>of their</hi> Falſe Prophet: <hi>Apply your ſelf therefore to this,</hi> holy Father, <hi>that ſo there may be a firm Peace and Confederacy eſtabliſhed among them, and exhort them to aſſiſt us, who are beſieged on all ſides by</hi> Wicked Mahometans, <hi>and</hi> Moors: <hi>The</hi> Turks <hi>and</hi> Moors <hi>can aſſiſt one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and their</hi> Kings <hi>and</hi> Rulers <hi>do all agree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: I have a</hi> Mahometan <hi>for my Neighbour, who is conſtantly ſupplied with</hi> Arms, Horſes, <hi>and all</hi> Military Weapons, <hi>by Princes of his own

               <p>WE believe in the Name of the Holy Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, who are One Lord, and Three Names; One Divinity, and Three Faces, though but One Similitude; and are an equal conjunction of Perſons; equal, I ſay, in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity; One Kingdom, One Throne, One Word, One Spirit; the Word of the Father, and the Son, and the Word of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and the Son is the ſame Word, the Word with God, the Word with the Holy Spirit, and with Himſelf, without any defect, or diviſion; the Son of the Father, the Son of the very Father, without any beginning, and at firſt the Son of the Father without a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the Secret and Myſtery of whoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57883:54"/>is known to none but the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This Son in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was the Word with God, and God was the Word: The Spirit of the Father, the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of the Son the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit its own Spirit; without any diminution or augmentation: That Holy Spirit is the Comforter of the living God, <hi>who proceedeth from the Father and the Son,</hi> and <hi>who ſpake by the mouth of the Prophets,</hi> and <hi>deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended in a flame of fire on the Apoſtles in the gate of Sion,</hi> and <hi>who preached the word of the Father,</hi> which Word the very Son was all over the World; wherefore as the Father is not firſt, notwithſtanding he is the Father; nor the Son laſt, notwithſtanding he is the Son; ſo likewiſe the Holy Spirit is neither firſt nor laſt, but they are Three Perſons in One God, who ſeeth, and is ſeen by no-body; and who by his only Council created all things. The Son did of his own accord, the Father being willing, and the Holy Ghoſt conſenting, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend from his higheſt Habitation, and was incarnate by the Holy Spirit in the Womb of the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> who was adorned with a double Virginity, the one Spiritual, the other Carnal; he was born without any Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his Mother, <hi>Mary,</hi> remaining a Virgin after her delivery; and by a Miracle, and a ſecret Flame of the Divinity brought forth her Son Jeſus, without blood, and without pain; who was perfectly Innocent, and without Sin; being perfect God, and perfect Man; and having only one Aſpect, he grew by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57883:54"/>as an Infant, ſucking the Milk of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> his Mother; and coming to Thirty Years of Age, he was baptiz'd in <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> and did walk, and was weary, and did hunger and thirſt, as other men do; all theſe things he ſuffered voluntarily, and of his own accord, and wrought many Miracles; reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, by the power of his Divinity, ſight to the Blind, curing the Lame, cleanſing the <hi>Lepers,</hi> raiſing the Dead; after all which, he himſelf was apprehended, and whipt, and ſcourged, and crucified: He languiſhed and died for our Sins, and by his Death over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Death, and the Devil; and by his lively Agony diſſolved our Sins, and bore our Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities: By the Baptiſm of his Blood, that is, his Death, he baptized the Patriarchs, and Prophets, and deſcended into Hell, where the Souls of <hi>Adam</hi> and his Sons were, as alſo his own Soul, which was from <hi>Adam,</hi> which Soul Chriſt received from the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> who by the power and ſplendor of his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and the ſtrength of his Croſs, broke the brazen fiery Gates of Hell, binding <hi>Satan</hi> with Iron Chains, and reſcuing <hi>Adam</hi> and his Sons. All theſe things Chriſt did, becauſe he was full of the Divinity; and the Divinity it ſelf was with his Soul, as it was alſo with his moſt holy Body, which Divinity gave vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to the Croſs, and was what he always had, and will have for ever, in Trinity and Unity in common with the Father: Neither did Chriſt, during the time he was in the Fleſh, ever want the Divinity and Dignity thereof for one moment. He was buried, and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57883:55"/>on the third day Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, the Prince of the Reſurrection, the moſt ſweet Jeſus Chriſt, Jeſus Chriſt the Prince of the Prieſts, Jeſus Chriſt the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> did with great power and ſtrength riſe, and after having finiſhed all things which were foretold by the holy Prophets, he aſcended with glory into Heaven, and ſitteth at the right hand of the Father, and will come with glory, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Croſs before him, and in his hand a Sword of Juſtice, to judge the quick and the dead, of whoſe Kingdom there ſhall be no end. I believe one Holy Catholick and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick Church; I believe one Baptiſm, which is the Remiſſion of Sins; and I do hope for the Reſurrection of the Dead, and the Life of the Age to come. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I believe the holy Lady <hi>Mary</hi> to be a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin both in Spirit and Fleſh, and do reverence her as the Mother of God, the Charity of all Nations, the Holy of Holies, and the Virgin of Virgins. I believe in the holy Wood of the Croſs, the Bed of the Agony of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God, who is our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for thorough him we are ſaved; which, notwithſtanding it is an offence to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> fooliſhneſs, we do preach, believing it to be the power of the Croſs of our Lord Chriſt, as our Doctor St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. I do believe St. <hi>Peter</hi> to be the Rock of the Law, which Law is built upon the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prophets, and the Foundation and Head of the Catholick and Apoſtolick Church of the Eaſt and Weſt, where the Name of Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is; the Power of which
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57883:55"/>Church is in St. <hi>Peter,</hi> as is alſo the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, with which he can open and ſhut, bind and looſe, and who ſhall ſit with the other Apoſtles, his Companions, upon Twelve Seats with honour and praiſe, together with our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; who upon the Day of Judgment is to paſs Sentence upon us, which will be a day of joy to the Saints, and of ſorrow and gnaſhing of teeth to Sinners, when they ſhall be thrown into the flames of Hell, with their Father the Devil. I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the holy Prophets, Apoſtles, and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, and Confeſſors, to have been true Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators of Chriſt, whom, together with the moſt holy Angels of God, I do venerate, and honour, and do in the ſame manner embrace and reverence all their Followers.</p>
               <p>I believe there ought to be an Oral Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of all Sins made to a Prieſt, by whoſe Prayers, thorough Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, I do hope to obtain the ſalvation of my Soul: I do furthermore acknowledge the <hi>Roman</hi> Pontiff to be the firſt Biſhop and Paſtor of all the Sheep of Chriſt. I do likewiſe obſerve and obey all Patriarchs, Cardinals, Archbiſhops, and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, of whom he is the Head of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This is my Faith, and Law, and the Faith and Law of the People of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> who are under the Empire of <hi>Precious John;</hi> which Faith and Love of Chriſt are ſo eſtabliſhed among us, that neither Death, nor Fire, nor Sword, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying on Chriſt's aſſiſtance, ſhall ever be able to oblige me to deny it, this being the Faith
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57883:56"/>we are all to carry on the Day of Judgment before the Face of Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>I come now to explain the Diſcipline, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and Law, which the Apoſtles, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> did lay down in the holy Books of Synods and Canons, called by us <hi>Manda Abethlis,</hi> thoſe Books of the Law of holy Church are Eight in number; concerning which, having had ſome diſcourſe with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Learned Men here in <hi>Portugal,</hi> I never met with one that had ever heard of them before. The Obſervances preſcribed in thoſe Books are as followeth. (1.) That we are to faſt upon all <hi>Wedneſdays,</hi> in memory of its ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been decreed by the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Council up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that day, That Chriſt ſhould be put to death: We are commanded likewiſe to faſt upon all <hi>Fridays,</hi> becauſe Chriſt was crucify'd, and died for our Sins on that day; upon which two days we are commanded to eat nothing till Sun-ſet. During the 40 days of <hi>Lent</hi> we are commanded to faſt with Bread and Water, and to be employed ſeven hours in the day in Divine Service; by the ſame Edicts we are commanded to Adminiſter the Sacraments in the Evenings of <hi>Wedneſdays</hi> and <hi>Fridays,</hi> becauſe our Saviour expired at that time on the Croſs: We are furthermore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to aſſemble together unanimouſly on the Lord's Day in the Church three hours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sun-riſing, to read and hear the Books of the Prophets, and afterwards to preach the Goſpel, and Adminiſter the Sacrament; they have furthermore appointed Nine days to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57883:56"/>as Feſtivities in honour of Chriſt, to wit, the <hi>Annunciation,</hi> the <hi>Nativity,</hi> the <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion,</hi> the <hi>Purification,</hi> or Day of Candles, of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> of <hi>Transfiguration, Palm-Sunday,</hi> until the <hi>Octaves</hi> of <hi>Good-Friday,</hi> which are twelve days, of the <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> and <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> with their Feſtivities according to theſe Books: We are without exception to eat Fleſh every day from <hi>Eaſter</hi> to <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> neither are we bound to faſt till after the <hi>Octaves</hi> of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> which is obſerved for the greater honour and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Reſurrection of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; they command us likewiſe to celebrate the Days of the Death and Aſſumption of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> with great honour: But beſides the Precepts of the Apoſtles, a certain <hi>Precious John,</hi> whoſe name was <hi>Zara Jacob,</hi> ordained 33 days in every year to be kept in honour of the ſaid Bleſſed Virgin; and a day in every Month in honour of Chriſt's Nativity, which is always the 25th of the Month; and a day likewiſe in every Month to be obſerved in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of St. <hi>Michael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Furthermore, in obedience to the ſaid <hi>Synod of the Apoſtles,</hi> we do celebrate the day of <hi>St.</hi> Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen, <hi>and other Martyrs,</hi> and are bound by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Apoſtles to obſerve two days, to wit, <hi>the Sabbath, and Lord's-Day,</hi> on which it is not lawful for us to do any work, no not the leaſt, on the Sabbath-Day, becauſe God, after he had finiſhed the Creation of the World, reſted thereon: Which Day, as God would have it called the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> ſo the not celebrating thereof with great honour and devotion, ſeems to be plainly contrary to God's
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57883:57"/>Will and Precept, who will <hi>ſuffer Heaven and Earth to paſs away ſooner than his Word;</hi> and that eſpecially, <hi>ſince Chriſt came not to diſſolve the Law, but to fulfil it.</hi> It is not therefore in imitation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> but in obedience to Chriſt, and his holy Apoſtles, that we obſerve that Day, the favour that was ſhewed herein to the <hi>Jews</hi> being transferred to us <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> ſo that, excepting <hi>Lent,</hi> we eat Fleſh every <hi>Saturday</hi> in the Year; but in the Kingdoms of <hi>Barnagaus, Tigre,</hi> and <hi>Mahon,</hi> the Chriſtians, according to ancient cuſtome, do eat Fleſh on all <hi>Saturdays</hi> and <hi>Sundays,</hi> even in <hi>Lent.</hi> We do obſerve <hi>the Lord's-Day</hi> after the manner of all other Chriſtians, in memory of <hi>Chriſt's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection:</hi> But as we are ſenſible that we have the obſervation of the <hi>Sabbath-Day</hi> from the <hi>Books of the Law,</hi> and not from thoſe <hi>of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</note> ſo we are not ignorant that the Goſpel is the end of the Law and the Prophets: On thoſe forementioned Days, we believe the Souls of the Juſt departed this Life, not to be tormented in Purgatory, which eaſe will be granted by God to them upon thoſe two moſt holy Days, until the term of their ſuffering for their Sins is expired, and they are entirely delivered; to the ſhortning and mitigating of which Torments, we believe the Alms that are given for the relief of the Souls in Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory do contribute much; towards the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of which Souls, the <hi>Patriarch grants no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The <hi>Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> never grants any Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> 
                  <hi>which we believe belongs to God only,</hi> and that he only conſtitutes the time of their puniſhment; neither does the <hi>Patriarch grant Indulgences on any occaſion.</hi> The Goſpel obligeth
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57883:57"/>us to obſerve only the <hi>Six Precepts,</hi> which Chriſt with his own mouth has explained, as follows, <hi>I was hungry, and you gave me meat; I was thirſty, and you gave me drink; I was a ſtranger, and you entertained me; naked, and you covered me; ſick, and you viſited me; in priſon, and you came unto me;</hi> which are all words that will be ſpoke by Chriſt at the Day of Judgment; For the Law, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>ſheweth us our ſins, which Law, without Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſins</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin.</note> 
                  <hi>none is able to keep: Paul</hi> witneſſeth likewiſe, that we are all born in ſin, by reaſon of the Tranſgreſſion and Curſe of our Mother <hi>Eve; Paul</hi> ſaith fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, that we died thorough <hi>Adam,</hi> and do live thorough Chriſt, who of his infinite mercy gave us theſe Six Precepts, that when he comes in Majeſty to judge the Quick and Dead, we may be ſaved: With which Words and Precepts he will on the Tremendous Day of Judgment allot everlaſting Glory to the Righteous, and to the Wicked Fire and Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Damnation. We do reckon only five <hi>mortal Sins,</hi> as they call them, which are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of the laſt Chapter of the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> where it is ſaid, <hi>Without are dogs, and witches, and unclean perſons, and murtherers, and idolaters, and every one who loveth and maketh a lye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is conſtituted by the holy Apoſtles,
<note place="margin">Clerks may mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> in <hi>the Book of Synods,</hi> that it is lawful for <hi>Clerks to marry,</hi> and that even after they have ſome knowledge of Divine Matters; who after they are married, are received into the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Presbyter, to which none are admitted before they are 30 years of Age; neither are
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57883:58"/>Baſtards ever admitted to it. Holy Orders are conferred by none but the Patriarch; and after the death of their firſt Wives, neither Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops nor Presbyters are permitted to marry a ſecond time, <hi>unleſs the Patriarch ſhall think fit to diſpence with them, which he does ſometimes,</hi> to emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Perſons, and when it is for the Publick good: Neither are they ſuffered to <hi>keep Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines,</hi> unleſs they do voluntarily give over of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiating, after which they muſt no more med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with holy things; and this is ſo ſtrictly obſerved, that the Presbyters, who marry a ſecond time, muſt not preſume ſo much as to take a conſecrated Candle in their hands; and if any Biſhop or Clerk is found to have <hi>had a Baſtard,</hi> he is deprived of <hi>his Orders,</hi> and all his Eccleſiaſtical <hi>Benefices;</hi> and his Goods, if he dies without Children lawfully begotten, do all go to <hi>Precious John,</hi> and not to the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch: That it is lawful for Presbyters to have Wives, we have received from St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who would rather have both Clergy and Laity to marry, than to burn; who ſaith likewiſe, that a Biſhop muſt be the Husband of one Wife, that is unblameable and ſober, and in the ſame manner the Deacons; and all Eccleſiaſticks as well as Secular ought to have their own law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Wives. Our Monks, notwithſtanding this, do not marry, and neither Laicks nor Clerks among us can have above one Wife at a time.</p>
               <p>With us Marriages are not celebrated at the Door of the Church, but in private Houſes; we are taught likewiſe by the Conſtitution of the Apoſtles, That if a Prieſt is convicted of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57883:58"/>
                  <hi>Adultery, Murther, Theft,</hi> or of <hi>having given falſe Teſtimony,</hi> that he ought to be deprived of his Orders, and puniſhed as other Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors in the ſame kind; and that an Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtick, or Layman, after having known his Wife, or having been polluted in his ſleep, ought not in 24 hours after that to enter into the Church, which Women are not to enter into, till the 7th day after their menſtrua's are over, and until they have waſhed all the Clothes they had on at that time: Furthermore, a Woman that is delivered of a Man-child, is not ſuffered to enter into the Church till after 40 days, and of a Female, not till about 80 days, which Cuſtom of the Old Law is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded likewiſe by the Apoſtles, whoſe Laws, Conſtitutions and Precepts, we do, ſo far as we are able, obſerve in all Caſes.</p>
               <p>It is likewiſe forbidden among us to ſuffer <hi>Heathens, or Dogs,</hi> or any other ſuch <hi>Creatures,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Furthermore it is not lawful for a Prieſt, or Layman, or any other Perſon of what condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſoever, after the receiving of the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Sacrament, <hi>to Spit from Morning till Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet,</hi>

               <p>We were among the firſt Chriſtians that received Baptiſm, that Sacrament having been brought among us by the Eunuch of <hi>Candace</hi> Queen of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> who is ſpoke of in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles;</hi> his Name, according to our Tradition, was <hi>Indick,</hi> from which time to this day, both Baptiſm and Circumciſion have been in uſe among us, and moſt Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly and Chriſtianly obſerved, and thorough God's Grace will be ſo for ever. We do obſerve nothing but what we find in the Law and the Prophets, and in the Books of the Synods of the Apoſtles; or if any thing elſe is obſerved by us, it is done only for the ſake of Order, and for the Peace of the Church, ſo as not to reckon it to be a Sin not to obſerve it;
<note place="margin">Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is not obſerved by them as a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but as a civil Cuſtom.</note> wherefore our Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not Uncleanneſs, but it is the Law and Grace, which was given to our Father <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and which he received from God as a Sign, not that he or his Sons ſhould be Saved by Circumciſion, but that his Poſterity might be diſtinguiſhed thereby from all other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and as for what is ſignified by Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, we do obſerve it exactly by having our Hearts Circumciſed; neither do we Glory upon the account of Circumciſion, or prefer our ſelves to other Chriſtians thereupon, or reckon our ſelves for it the more acceptable to God, with whom there is no acceptance of Perſons, as <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifies; who tells us likewiſe, that we cannot be Saved by Circumciſion, but by Faith; for in Chriſt Jeſus <hi>neither circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion availeth any thing, nor uncircumciſion, but a new creature;</hi> now by this, <hi>Paul</hi> did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57883:61"/>to deſtroy the Law, but to eſtabliſh it, for he himſelf was Circumciſed, being of the Seed of <hi>Benjamin;</hi> he Circumciſed <hi>Timothy</hi> likewiſe after he was made a Chriſtian, his Mother being a <hi>Jeweſs,</hi> notwithſtanding his Father was a <hi>Gentile,</hi> knowing that God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves both of Circumciſion that is in Faith, and of Uncircumciſion which is by Faith, for as he himſelf tells, <hi>he was made all things to all men, that he might ſave all; to the Jews he became a Jew, that he might gain the Jews; and to thoſe that were under the law, as if he had been under the law,</hi> which he was not, <hi>that he might gain thoſe who were under the law; and to thoſe who were without the law, as if he had been without the law,</hi> whereas he was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Law of God, but was in the Law of Chriſt, <hi>that he might gain them who were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the law;</hi> he alſo <hi>became weak, that he might gain the weak;</hi> which he did, that he might ſhew that it was not by Circumciſion, but by Faith that we muſt be Saved; and ſo when he Preached to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> he ſpoke to them as <hi>Hebrews,</hi> ſaying, <hi>God hath at ſundry times, and in divers manners ſpoke to our forefathers by the Prophets;</hi> and from thence proved to them that Chriſt was of the Seed of <hi>David</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Fleſh; he Preached likewiſe to them, That Chriſt was with our Fathers in their Tents in the Deſart, and did lead them by the hand of <hi>Joſhua</hi> into the Land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; he furthermore teſtified, That Chriſt was the Prince of the Prieſts, and had entered into the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> which is the New Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle; and had by the <hi>Sacrifice of his
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57883:62"/>Body and Blood,</hi> aboliſhed the <hi>blood of Goats and Bulls,</hi> by which none that came, could be juſtified; and that he had ſpoke to the <hi>Jews</hi> in divers manners, and did ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be Worſhipped by his People with divers rites, and an holy and uncorrupt Faith.</p>
               <p>Furthermore,
<note place="margin">The Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Chriſtian Parents before they are Baptized are called <hi>Half-Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</hi>
                  </note> Thoſe Children are looked upon by us as <hi>Half-Chriſtians;</hi> who, as I am told, are reckoned to be <hi>Heathens</hi> by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church, upon account of their dying without Baptiſm; whereas being the Children of the holy Blood of Parents, who have been Sanctified by Baptiſm and the Holy Spirit, and the Blood of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which Three Teſtimonies, all that are Chriſtians are reputed to be ſuch, they ought to be eſteemed <hi>Half-Chriſtians;</hi> for <hi>there are Three who bear Witneſs on Earth, the Spirit, the Water, and the Blood,</hi> as St. <hi>John</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth in his firſt Canonical Epiſtle; the Goſpel ſaith likewiſe, <hi>That a good tree bringeth forth good fruit, and an evil tree evil fruit;</hi> wherefore the Children of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are not as the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the <hi>Gentiles, Jews,</hi> and <hi>Mahometans,</hi> who are dry Trees without Fruit, but are choſen in the Womb of their Mothers, as the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> and <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt were.</p>
               <p>The Children of Chriſtian Women are furthermore Choſen and Sanctified by the Communication of the Body and Blood of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, received by their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, from whom they derive their Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, during the time they are in their Wombs; for as an Infant in the Womb re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57883:62"/>or is ſorrowful, according as its Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is affected, ſo it is nouriſhed likewiſe by its Mother's nutriment; for as our Lord ſaith in his Holy Goſpel, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall eat my body and drink my blood, ſhall never taſt death;</hi> and again, <hi>He that eateth my body, and drinketh my blood, ſhall be with me: Paul</hi> likewiſe ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the ſame purpoſe, when he ſaith, <hi>the unbelieving husband is juſtified by the believing wife, and the unbelieving wife by the believing husband, otherwiſe your children would be unclean, whereas now they are holy.</hi> Now if the Children of an Unbelieving Mother are notwithſtanding that, Sanctified by the Faith of their Father, how much more holy muſt they be, whoſe Father and Mother are both Believers? For which reaſon it is much more pious to call ſuch Infants before they are Baptized, <hi>Half-Chriſtians,</hi> than <hi>Pagans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtles in their <hi>Book of Synods</hi> do likewiſe affirm, That all who had Faith, though they were not Baptized, may be called <hi>Half-Chriſtians;</hi> in which Books it is ſaid, that if a <hi>Jew,</hi> or <hi>Gentile,</hi> or <hi>Mahometan,</hi> do em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Faith, he ſhall not be received pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, but muſt firſt come to the door of the Church, there to hear Sermons, and the words of our Saviour Chriſt, and that being diſpoſed to Believe, he may underſtand what <hi>Chriſt's yoke is,</hi> after which he may be called an <hi>Half-Chriſtian,</hi> even before he is admitted to Baptiſm; which is alſo according to the Goſpel, which ſaith, <hi>He that believeth, and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved; but he that believeth not, ſhall be condemned.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:57883:63"/>
               <p>It is alſo the cuſtom among us, for Women when they are with Child to Confeſs their Sins and receive the Lord's Body before they are Delivered; and they who neglect to do this, are looked upon as Wicked and Impious Chriſtians, as are alſo their Husbands for not having obliged them to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Confirmation</hi> and <hi>Extream Unction</hi> are not <hi>reckoned Sacraments among</hi> us,
<note place="margin">Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Extream Unction no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> neither are they in uſe in our Church, as I ſee they are in the <hi>Roman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We do ſurthermore reckon it contrary to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Inſtitutions of the Apoſtles, to eat <hi>unclean Meats,</hi> from all which we do abſtain merely in Obedience to the Law and the Scriptures; which with us conſiſts of <hi>Eighty one Books;</hi> that is to ſay, the Old Teſtament conſiſts of Forty one Books,
<note place="margin">The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture the perfect Rule of Faith.</note> and the New of Thirty five; which Canon, or Number of Books, we have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly delivered to us by the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to which it is not lawful for us to Add or Diminiſh any thing, no not though an Angel from Heaven ſhould perſuade us to it; and we do look upon him as Accurſed, that ſhall offer to do any ſuch thing; ſo that neither our <hi>Patriarch</hi> nor our Biſhop do reckon that they can either by themſelves, or in a <hi>Council,</hi> make any <hi>Laws, That People are under an Obligation of a Mortal Sin to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Books of <hi>our Synods</hi> it is ordained by the Holy Apoſtles, That we muſt confeſs our ſelves before we can receive Penance from a Confeſſor, according to the greatneſs
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57883:63"/>of our Sin: They teach us likewiſe how we ought to Pray, and Faſt, and how to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Charity. Confeſſion is much in uſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us; for we have no ſooner committed a Sin, than we run and throw our ſelves at the feet of a Confeſſor; this is the conſtant pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of all Men and Women of whatſoever Quality or Condition; and whenever we Confeſs, we do receive the Body of our Lord under both Species,
<note place="margin">They all receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in both Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. It is not kept in their Churches.</note> and in Wheaten and Unleavened Bread; ſo that if we Confeſs our ſelves daily, we do daily receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well Layicks as Eccleſiaſticks. The Sacrament of the Euchariſt <hi>is not kept in our Churches,</hi> as it is here in <hi>Europe;</hi> neither is it at any time Adminiſtred to the Sick, until after they are recovered. All among us Layicks, as well as Clerks, do receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament at leaſt Three times a Week; which is never received any where but in the Church,
<note place="margin">It is never received but in the Church.</note> no not by the Patriarch, or <hi>Precious John</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>We do always make uſe of the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, and do never go to any other, but when our own is abſent, to whom when he returns we are bound to repair. The Confeſſors do in the Name of the Church, abſolve from all Sins, there being no caſes, no not the moſt heinous, reſerved to the Biſhop or Patriarch; Presbyters are not allowed to Confeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to thoſe that they Confeſs; and among us all Presbyters and Monks, and all Officers of the Church, do live by their own Labour; for the Church hath no Tythes, it has Lands which are Cultivated by the Prieſts and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57883:64"/>Monks, either in Perſon, or by their ſervants; and as for Alms, they receive none but thoſe that are offered in the Church for the Burial of the dead, and other Holy Offices; it not being lawful for any of them to beg about the ſtreets, or to extort Alms from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people.</p>
               <p>Furthermore,
<note place="margin">The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is never admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred above once a day in a Church. It is not ſhewed to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. No Maſſes are ſaid for the Dead.</note> in our Churches there is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>but one Maſs a day,</hi> which we do reckon to be a Sacrifice; neither is it lawful for us, according to ancient Cuſtom, to Celebrate more; for which Maſs we never receive any Money; the Sacrament of the <hi>Euchariſt is not ſhewed to the People among us,</hi> as I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it is here; and all Prieſts, Deacons, and Subdeacons, and all People whatſoever that are preſent at the Celebration, <hi>are obliged to Communicate.</hi> We ſay no Maſſes for the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Souls,</hi> but our Dead are Buried in a Conſecrated Place with Prayers and Croſſes, over whom, among other things, we recite the beginning of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, and do offer Alms for them the day after they are Buried, and at certain other times, when we have Funeral Feaſts.</p>
               <p>This is what I have to ſay of our Faith and Religion.</p>
               <p>But whereas ſince my coming to <hi>Portugal,</hi> I have had ſeveral Debates with ſome Doctors, namely with <hi>Didacus Ortis</hi> Biſhop of the Iſland of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and Dean of the King's Chappel, and <hi>Pedro Magalho,</hi> concerning the <hi>diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Meats,</hi> it will not be improper for me to ſay ſomething of it in this place.</p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:57883:64"/>
               <p>It is to be obſerved, that it is in obedience to the Old Teſtament that we obſerve a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of meats, which diſtinction is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by the <hi>Word of God,</hi> who was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and walked and converſed with his Apoſtles; which Living Word of God had always an entire and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revocable Speech or Word, and who did no where in his Goſpel ſay, that ſuch things might be eat, as were before prohibited as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean. For as to thoſe words in the Goſpel, <hi>That whatſoever entreth into the mouth doth not defile the man, but that which cometh forth of the mouth;</hi> Chriſt's intent therein, was not to diſſolve the Law he had formerly enacted, but only to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the Superſtition of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who blamed the Apoſtles for having eat Bread with unwaſhen hands; neither did the Apoſtles,
<note place="margin">A long Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from Meats that are made unclean by the Law.</note> while they converſed with Chriſt, make uſe of unclean Meats, or ſo much as taſte any thing that was prohibited by the Law, which was what none of them offered to tranſgreſs, no not after the time of our Lord's Paſſion, when they began to preach the Goſpel; there being nothing in their Writings from whence it can be gathered, that they did ever kill or eat any thing that is unclean. It is true, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Eat all that is ſold in the ſhambles, asking nothing for conſcience ſake;</hi> and again, <hi>If any that are infidels invite you to a feaſt, and you are diſpoſed to go, eat whatſoever is ſet before you, asking no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions for conſcience ſake:</hi> And again, <hi>If any one ſhall ſay, This is offered to idols, do not eat for his ſake that told you ſo, and for conſcience ſake,</hi> &amp;c. All which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpoke in compliance with thoſe
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57883:65"/>who are weak in the Faith, betwixt whom and the <hi>Jews</hi> there were frequent Debates; and in order to the putting a ſtop to thoſe Diſputes, the Apoſtle complied much with the weaker Chriſtians, which he did not do that he would have the Law broke, but that by gratifying ſuch People in the relaxation of Rites, he might allure them to the Faith.</p>
               <p>The ſame Apoſtle ſaith likewiſe, <hi>Let not him that eateth, deſpiſe him that eateth not; for he that eateth, eateth unto the Lord; and he that eareth not, eateth not unto the Lord.</hi> It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an unworthy thing to reprove Chriſtians, who are Strangers, with ſo much bitterneſs, as I have been reproved here, concerning this very matter, and other little things, which do no ways belong to Faith: It would certainly be much wiſer for Chriſtians, whether <hi>Greeks, Armenians, Ethiopians,</hi> or of any of the Seven Chriſtian Churches, to bear with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Charity, and in the Bowels of Chriſt, in all ſuch matters, and to ſuffer one another to live and converſe with their Chriſtian Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, being all Sons of Baptiſm, and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in the true Faith; neither is there any cauſe why they ſhould debate ſo ſharply about Ceremonies; or why every one ſhould not be ſuffered to obſerve his own, and that without hating and perſecuting others for theirs; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought any one in a ſtrange Countrey to be debarred the Communion of the Church for obſerving his own Church-Ceremonies.</p>
               <p>As to that we meet with in the <hi>Acts,</hi> of <hi>Peter</hi>'s ſeeing a Cloth let down from Heaven by the corners, wherein were all Four-footed
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57883:65"/>Beaſts, and all creeping Creatures, and Birds of the Air; and of his having heard a Voice that commanded him, <hi>to riſe, and kill, and eat;</hi> to which <hi>Peter</hi> replied, <hi>Far be it from me, Lord, for I have never eat any thing that is common and unclean;</hi> to whom the Voice anſwered, <hi>What God has purified, that do not thou call unclean;</hi> which having been done three ſeveral times, the Veſſel was then immediately taken up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven; whereupon the Spirit ſent him ſtraightways to <hi>Ceſarea</hi> to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> a holy Man, fearing God, to whom when <hi>Peter</hi> ſpake, the Holy Spirit deſcended on all who heard the Word of God: After which <hi>Peter</hi> baptized <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his whole Family: Now when the Apoſtles and Brethren, who were in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi> came to hear of what <hi>Peter</hi> had done, they were angry, and asked him, How he came to go to men who <hi>were uncircumciſed, and to eat with them?</hi> but after <hi>Peter</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to them the whole Viſion, they were ſatisfied, and returned thanks to God, ſaying, He <hi>hath given repentance unto life to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles;</hi> and they remembred the word of the Lord, which he ſpoke when he aſcended into Heaven, <hi>Go over all nations, and preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to all creatures, in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; and he that believeth, and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved; and he that believeth not, ſhall be condemned:</hi> Then the Apoſtles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to preach the Goſpel over the whole World to every Creature, in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, inſomuch that their ſound went thorough the whole Earth: Now this Viſion, wherein things clean and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57883:66"/>unclean appeared, we of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> interpret thus: The <hi>clean living Creatures</hi> were the <hi>People</hi> of <hi>Iſrael, the unclean were the</hi> Gentiles; who were therefore ſaid to be unclean, becauſe <hi>they worſhipped Idols,</hi> and did the Works of the Devil, which are unclean. So that the Voice ſaying, <hi>Peter</hi> kill, was the ſame as if it had ſaid, <hi>Teach and preach the Faith, and the Law of Chriſt,</hi> both to the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> beſides, it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that we read no where in the Scriptures of <hi>Peter,</hi> or of any other of the Apoſtles, killing or eating any thing that was unclean after this Viſion: We are to obſerve likewiſe, That when the Scriptures ſpeak <hi>of Bread,</hi> it is not to be underſtood of a Corporal Food, but of the Doctrine of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>It is therefore adviſeable for all Doctors and Preachers to teach high and ſublime things of this Linen Cloth which was ſhewed to <hi>Peter,</hi> and not low things, which do no way apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to Salvation; and leaſt of all to draw Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments from thence, to prove it to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for us to eat things that are unclean, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no ſuch matter can be gathered from the Scripture; but that is not all, for the Apoſtles themſelves, in their <hi>Book of Synods,</hi> have forbid us to eat any thing that <hi>is ſtrangled or tore, or half eaten by Beaſt, or Blood,</hi> he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord loveth cleanneſs and ſobriety, and hateth gluttony and pollution; and loveth thoſe much who abſtain from Fleſh, and thoſe more who faſt with Bread, and Water, and Herbs, as <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> did, who eat nothing elſe: As alſo <hi>Paul</hi> the Hermite, who
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57883:66"/>lived in the Deſert, and faſted 80 years; as St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> and St. <hi>Macarius,</hi> and a great number of their Spiritual Sons, who never ſo much as taſted Fleſh.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, Brethren, we ought not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn and perſecute our Neighbours; for St. <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that ſpeaketh evil of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or judgeth his brother, ſpeaketh evil of the law: Paul</hi> teacheth likewiſe, <hi>That it is much better for people to reſt ſatisfied with their own tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, than to contend with their Chriſtian bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren about the law; and that in ſuch matters they ought not to be wiſer than is neceſſary, but to be wiſe to ſobriety, according as God hath dealt to every man a meaſure of faith.</hi> Wherefore it is a very undecent thing to contend with our brethren about the law and diſtinction of meats, ſince meat cannot commend us to God;
<note place="margin">A chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition.</note> and eſpecially ſince St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath ſaid, <hi>Whether ye eat plentifully, or do not eat, ye are never the worſe:</hi> Let us therefore look after higher things, and the food that is heavenly, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear ſuch low and empty diſputations. What I have writ concerning Traditions, I have not writ out of a ſpirit of contention, but to defend my Countreymen againſt the violent reproofs of thoſe who paid ſo little reſpect to the moſt Potent <hi>Precious John</hi> and his Subjects, as to load them with Reproaches, calling us <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Mahometans,</hi> becauſe <hi>we circumciſe,</hi> and <hi>ſanctify the Sabbath,</hi> after the manner of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and do continue our Faſts till Sunſet, as the <hi>Mahometans</hi> do: They do likewiſe object to us with great bitterneſs, That our Prieſts do marry, after the manner of the Lay-men;
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57883:67"/>and that miſtruſting our <hi>firſt Baptiſm,</hi> we are baptized yearly; and that we circumciſe not only Males but Females alſo, which the <hi>Jews</hi> never did; laſtly, that we obſerve a diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Meats with great ſtrictneſs; and that we call Children Half-Chriſtians before they are baptized: To which things I was obliged to return an Anſwer, to vindicate our people from the Calumnies that are caſt upon them, and to render the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors more affable to us, who, how piouſly I will not ſay, have ever ſince I came into <hi>Portugal,</hi> which is now Seven Years, deny'd me the Sacrament; ſo that, I cannot ſpeak it but with extreme Grief and Tears, I am treated by my Chriſtian Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren as a Heathen and an <hi>Anathema:</hi> He that enliveneth all things, to whom I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it, does take notice of theſe matters.</p>
               <p>I was not ſent by the moſt Potent Lord the Emperor of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> to the <hi>Roman Pontiff,</hi> and to the moſt Serene <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> to brangle and diſpute, but to contract a Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Alliance betwixt them; not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe or diminiſh Human Traditions, but to enquire diligently into the Errors of <hi>Arius</hi> the Prince of Hereticks; and to learn whether the <hi>European</hi> Chriſtians do agree with us in confuting his Opinions; upon account of whoſe Errors a Council of Three hundred and eighteen Biſhops were aſſembled at <hi>Nice</hi> under Pope <hi>Julius:</hi> And that I might learn likewiſe whether what the Apoſtles have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in their <hi>Book of Synods,</hi> was obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved among the <hi>European</hi> Chriſtians; to wit, That Two Councils be celebrated every Year
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57883:67"/>in the Chriſtian Church, to treat concerning Matters of Faith; the firſt whereof they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be aſſembled at the Feaſt of <hi>Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt,</hi> and the ſecond on the 10th. of <hi>October:</hi> And to learn alſo how it ſtood betwixt us as to the Errors of <hi>Macedonius;</hi> upon whoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count a Council of an Hundred and Fifty Biſhops was aſſembled at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> under Pope <hi>Damaſus:</hi> And alſo the Errors of <hi>Neſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> againſt whom a Council of Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred were aſſembled at <hi>Epheſus</hi> under Pope <hi>Celeſtine:</hi> And laſtly, That I might be inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Fourth and Great Council of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi> aſſembled upon the account of the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of <hi>Eutyches,</hi> at the time when St. <hi>Leo</hi> was Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> from which Council, after having had hot Diſputes, the Biſhops returned, without having concluded any thing for the Peace of the Church; both Parties maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own Opinions.</p>
               <p>The Books of which Synods, and of divers others that were afterwards celebrated, my Lord the Emperor of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> hath by him, who is very much troubled, as are alſo all his Chriſtian Subjects, at the Tares which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, the Enemy of Truth, has ſown among Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Our people from the beginning have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the <hi>Roman Pontiff</hi> to be the firſt Biſhop, to whom, as the Vicar of Chriſt, we do at this time ſubmit our ſelves; and in whoſe Court we would be frequently, were it not for the great diſtance we are at from it, and our being denied a free paſſage through the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Kingdoms which lye betwixt
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57883:68"/>us; inſomuch that many times after having expoſed our Perſons to great dangers, we are not able to get thither.</p>
               <p>The moſt Prudent and Invincible King <hi>Emanuel,</hi> of happy memory, was the firſt that by Divine Direction opened a Paſſage by his Navigation to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies;</hi> which for the future gives us great hopes of a commodious Correſpondence: <hi>Emanuel</hi> made himſelf Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the <hi>Red Sea</hi> with his Fleets; not being diſcouraged from doing it by the greatneſs of the Charge, that ſo he might augment the Faith of Chriſt, and open a Paſſage for us to correſpond with him, and to make uſe of each other's aſſiſtance; by which means we do hope, with our united Forces, to drive all the <hi>Mahometans</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> not only from the Coaſts of the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> but alſo out of <hi>Arabia, Perſia,</hi> and <hi>India.</hi> And as we do not in the leaſt doubt but that we ſhall be able to do this, ſo we do wiſh that all <hi>European</hi> Chriſtians were in Peace with one another, that ſo they might join together,

I do wiſh the great God may bring the Intentions and Endeavours of my Prince, which I was ſent hither to promote, to an happy Iſſue, ſo as to be for his Glory. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having given ſome Account of theſe things, I will now with great Brevity ſay ſomething of the ſtate of our Patriarch, and Empire.</p>
               <p>When our Patriarch dies, <hi>Precious John</hi> our Emperor immediately diſpatcheth a Meſſenger to the Monks that live at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A falſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Abuna.</hi>
                  </note> who having received notice, and the Preſents that are ſent to the <hi>Holy Sepulchre</hi> by the Emperor, do ſtraightways chuſe a Patriarch by a Majori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Voices, who muſt always be an <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi> Monk, of an unblameable life.</p>
               <p>When they have choſen a Patriarch, they ſeal up their Votes, and tranſmit them by the Emperor's Meſſenger, to the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> reſiding at <hi>Grand Cairo,</hi> who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately conſecrates the Monk that is choſen to that great Dignity, and ſends him with the Meſſenger into <hi>Ethiopia.</hi> The Perſon elected,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57883:69"/>according to ancient cuſtom, muſt be a Monk of the Order of St. <hi>Anthony</hi> the Hermit; and who when he arrives in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> is there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with great Joy and Honour. This Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair is not ſometimes finiſhed under a Year or two; during which Vacancy, all the Rents of the Patriarch are paid to <hi>Precious John.</hi> The chief buſineſs of the Patriarch <hi>is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Holy Orders,</hi> which none beſides him can either give or take away. He collates to no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricks, nor any other Eccleſiaſtical Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; which are all in the Gift of <hi>Precious John,</hi> who beſtows them as he thinks good. When the Patriarch, whoſe Revenues are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great, dieth, the Emperor is his ſole Heir. It is furthermore the buſineſs of the Patriarch to excommunicate all ſuch as are obſtinate; to which Cenſures there is ſo great a Reſpect paid, that all who ſlight them are condemned for their whole life to a ſtrict and perpetual Faſt. He <hi>grants no Indulgences,</hi> neither are the Sacraments of the Church denied to any Sinners, but Murtherers.</p>
               <p>The Patriarch in our Tongue is called <hi>Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na;</hi> only he who at preſent is in poſſeſſion of that Dignity, is called by his Baptiſmal Name, which is <hi>Mark;</hi> he is an Hundred Years of Age and upward.</p>
               <p>With us the Year begins on the Firſt day of <hi>September,</hi> which falls always on the Vigil of <hi>John the Baptiſt;</hi> the other Holidays, as the <hi>Nativity, Eaſter,</hi> &amp;c. are obſerved at the ſame time as they are in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:57883:69"/>
               <p>The Goſpel and Faith of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt was firſt preached among us by <hi>Philip</hi> the Apoſtle. If you would know the name of our Emperor, it is always Precious <hi>John,</hi> and not Presbyter <hi>John,</hi> as it is here falſly reported to be in our Language: It is <hi>John Belul,</hi> and in the <hi>Chalde, John Encoo,</hi> or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious or High <hi>John:</hi> Neither is he ever called, as <hi>Matthew</hi> falſly reported, Emperor of the <hi>Habaſſins,</hi> but of the <hi>Ethiopians;</hi> for he being an <hi>Armenian</hi> did not thoroughly underſtand our Affairs, and leaſt of all thoſe relating to our Faith; which made him report ſeveral things to the wiſe King <hi>Emanuel</hi> of happy Memory, that were falſe; which was not done by him with an intention to deceive; for he was an honeſt Man, but becauſe he was not well Inſtructed in the Matters of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>The Empire does not of right deſcend to the Eldeſt Son, but to him on whom the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror is pleaſed to beſtow it. So the preſent Emperor was the third Brother, and got the Crown by a Pious piece of Reverence: For the laſt Emperor having when he was upon his Death-Bed commanded all his Sons to ſit down by him on Royal Thrones, they all did ſo, except my Maſter, who ſaid, <hi>Far be it from me to ſit in the Chair of my Lord;</hi> for which act of Piety, his Father beſtowed the Empire up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. His Name is <hi>David,</hi> and his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of Chriſtians and Heathens are very large, in which there are divers Kings, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Earls, Barons and Nobles, who are all extreamly ſubmiſſive to his commands. He
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57883:70"/>hath no other than Foreign Coin within his Territories, Gold and Silver being paid, and received among us by Weight: We have a great many Cities and Towns, tho not built as they are here in <hi>Portugal.</hi> Precious <hi>John</hi> keeps his Court perpetually in the Camp, which he does on purpoſe to accuſtom the Nobility to the Hardſhips and Exerciſes of War: Neither is it to be omitted, that we are Beſieged on all Sides, by the Enemies of our Faith, with whom we have frequent Battels, but are always Victorious; which Victories we Attribute to the Divine Aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>A Written Law is not in uſe among us, neither are the Complaints of <hi>Litigants</hi> Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacted by Papers, but by word of Mouth; which makes, that Law-Suits are not Protracted by the Avarice of the Judges and Advocates to any great length.</p>
               <p>I am to tell you likewiſe, that <hi>Matthew</hi> was not ſent by our Emperor <hi>David,</hi> to the Invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Powerful King <hi>Emanuel</hi> of happy Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, but by Queen <hi>Helena,</hi> who was Dowager to the Emperor; <hi>The Hand</hi> of <hi>Mary,</hi> who was Grandfather to <hi>David,</hi> and who, <hi>David</hi> being under Age, at that time was Regent of <hi>Ethiopia:</hi> She was undoubtedly a moſt Wiſe and Religious Princeſs, and was Miſtreſs of ſo much Learning, that ſhe Compoſed two Books in the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Tongue: The Title of the firſt was <hi>Euzara Clebaa,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Praiſe the Lord with Organs;</hi> in which ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed Learnedly concerning the Trinity, and the Virginity of the Bleſſed Virgin: The Second is called <hi>Chedale C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ay,</hi> that is, the Beam of the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57883:70"/>Sun, in which ſhe has divers accurate Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes concerning the Law of God.</p>
               <p>All theſe things relating to the Faith, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and State of our Countrey, I <hi>Zaga Zabo, that is, the Grace of the Father;</hi> a Biſhop Presbyter, and <hi>Bagama Raz,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>a Soldier and Viceroy of the Province of</hi> Bagana, could not deny to Thee <hi>Damianus</hi> my deareſt Son in Chriſt, nor indeed to any one that ſhould have deſired it of me: And that for two Reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe I was commanded by the Moſt Potent Lord, Precious <hi>John,</hi> Emperor of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> not to conceal any thing relating to our Faith and Countrey, from ſuch as ſhould deſire to have an account thereof, but to Communicate the whole truth of all ſuch matters to them, both by Writing and word of Mouth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe I judged it convenient to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint this part of the World with our Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Rites and Inſtitutions; and that the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe I had neither ſaid, nor writ any thing thereof before; not that I grudged my labour, but becauſe no Chriſtian Soul ſince I came into <hi>Portugal,</hi> had ever deſired me to do it, which is a thing I cannot wonder at enough.</p>
               <p>I do therefore, knowing you to be extreamly curious to be acquainted with our Affairs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you by the Wounds and Croſs of Chriſt, to Tranſlate this Confeſſion of Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion into the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue, that ſo the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of our Manners and Rites may be
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57883:71"/>known to all <hi>European</hi> Chriſtians; and if you ſhould at any time happen to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> I muſt intreat you to Salute the Pope, Cardinals, Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, Archbiſhops, Biſhops and all the other Worſhippers of Chriſt in my Name with the Kiſs of Peace: And to deſire the Pope to ſend <hi>Francis Alvarez</hi> back to me with an Anſwer to the Letters of my Moſt Potent Lord the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> that ſo I may at laſt return to my own Country, and once more ſee my own Houſe, having been detained here too long already; and that before I am arreſted by Death, which by reaſon of my great Age I muſt be in a ſhort time, I may carry back an Anſwer to my Maſter; and having finiſhed my Embaſſy, may Dedicate the remainder of my Days to God, and Divine Matters: And in caſe this Treatiſe ſhould not be ſo accurately Compoſed as it ought to be, I muſt beſeech you to Correct it, and Adapt it to the <hi>Latin</hi> Phraſe, but ſo as not to alter the ſenſe.</p>
               <p>Finally I muſt intreat you, in the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof to conſult the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaments, that you may the better underſtand out of what Books I have taken my Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and may be able to tranſlate them the more faithfully. And in caſe matters ſhould not be ſo curiouſly handled therein, as to ſatisfy Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Readers, the fault thereof muſt be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to my want of <hi>Chaldee</hi> Books, of which I have not one by me; thoſe I brought from home with me, having been unhappily loſt in the Voyage. So that what I ſet down, was what occurred to my Memory; which I have done with great Fidelity. <hi>Farewell my moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved

               <p>After having writ this, I called to mind the paſſage wherein I had affirmed, That Chriſt had deſcended into the lower parts, for the ſake of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Soul, and his own which he receiv'd from his Mother, the holy Virgin <hi>Mary:</hi> Of the truth whereof we have a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Teſtimony in the <hi>Books of Government,</hi> as we call them; which Books were delivered by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt to his Apoſtles, and they are likewiſe the <hi>Myſtery of Doctrines;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that their Teſtimony is admitted as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible among us. The <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Divines are of Opinions that are contrary to thoſe Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; but that does not hinder that from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing true which theſe Books affirm, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Souls of men are derived from <hi>Adam;</hi> that is to ſay, As our Fleſh is derived from the Fleſh of <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo our Soul, as a Burning Light, is derived likewiſe from the Soul of <hi>Adam,</hi> which makes us to be all of the Seed of <hi>Adam,</hi> both as to Body and Soul.</p>

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:57883:72"/>Supremacy, Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> and <hi>Purgatory,</hi> it is viſible that to ingratiate himſelf with the Pope and King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and to make his Court the better, he did both ſtretch his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and ſacrifice his Reſentments to the Publick Character he bore: Thoſe Doctrines having never been at any time the Doctrines of the <hi>Habaſſin</hi> Church: Which Charge of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity is juſtified both by the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and his Countreyman <hi>Gregory,</hi> who never ſpoke of him but with deteſtation, calling him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly a <hi>Beaſt of the Field.</hi> And as to his ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that his Emperor's Name was <hi>Precious,</hi> and not <hi>Preſtor John,</hi> it was a plain Trick in him, deſigning by ſuch a ſlight Correction of that word, to eſtabliſh the opinion of his Maſter being the Prince was meant by <hi>Preſtor John</hi> in <hi>Europe:</hi> For whereas the preſent Emperor's Name was <hi>David,</hi> ſo I do not find that there was one of the Name of <hi>John</hi> in the whole Line of thoſe Princes.

               <p>For whereas the <hi>Habaſſin,</hi> as is plain from his own Letters, did expect nothing leſs from his new Alliance, than the utter extirpation of all his Infidel Neighbours, <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans;</hi> ſo natural it is for people to overvalue

<note place="margin">The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the arrival of the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſes,</hi> writes to <hi>Gama</hi> to come and joyn him.</note> The Emperor, ſo ſoon as he received advice thereof, writ immediately to <hi>Gama,</hi> deſiring him to March towards him with all the haſte he could make, to prevent the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies putting himſelf betwixt them to hinder their conjunction.</p>
               <p>But whatever was the cauſe of it, it was the 5th. of <hi>December</hi> before <hi>Gama</hi> decamped from <hi>Debora;</hi> when taking the Empreſs along with him, and being joyned by 2000 <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſins,</hi> he Marched toward the Emperor in as good order as the nature of the Countrey would permit him; the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> who were employed by <hi>Granhe</hi> to raiſe Money, flying before him as he Marched; and the <hi>Habaſſins,</hi> ſo ſoon as their <hi>Lord Dans</hi> were gone, running in to him from all parts for Protection, ſupplying him with all Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. On the 1ſt. of <hi>February</hi> 1542. they came before a ſtrong Mountain which <hi>Granhe</hi> had got into his hands by Treachery, into which by reaſon of its Commanding all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey about, he had put a Gariſon of 1500 men; this Mountain is not above Three days March in a right line from <hi>Debora;</hi> but what made them to be near Two Months in getting to it, was their having fetched a great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs in order to the reducing of ſeveral of the beſt Provinces to the Emperor's Obedience,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57883:77"/>which they did only by Marching thorough them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gama</hi> finding all they had done, if they did not make themſelves Maſters of this Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, would ſignify nothing, did reſolve, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it coſt him, to attempt it; the Empreſs was much againſt his doing it, and gave this for her Reaſon, That ſhould the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> be baffled in that Attempt, as conſidering the Strength of the Place and the Gariſon, it was too likely they might, the <hi>Mahometans</hi> to whom at preſent their Name was become ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, would recover their courage again: But <hi>Gama</hi> offered ſuch ſtrong reaſons for their not leaving ſuch a Gariſon behind them, that the Empreſs was overcome by them, and gave her conſent to its being Attaqued.</p>
               <p>The Mountain was both High and Steep, and on the top of it was a Plain of near a League in compaſs, in which was water ſufficient for the Gariſon: It had Three Entries which were all ſtrongly fortified both by Art and Nature; The Chief of them was called <hi>Amba Cane<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Gama</hi> after having ſtrictly Survey'd it, judged it the beſt way to make an Aſſault upon all the Entries at once; and accordingly charged <hi>Francis Velho,</hi> and <hi>Manoel da Cunha</hi> with the Firſt, and <hi>John de Fanſeca,</hi> and <hi>Francis d' Abrew,</hi> with the Second; who had each of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57883:78"/>them Three Field-Pieces, taking the Third, which was by much the ſtrongeſt, to himſelf. In the Night he ordered ſeveral falſe Attacks to be made, on purpoſe to make the Enemy ſpend their Arrows, which they did in great ſhowers, without Killing or Wounding one of the <hi>Portugueſes;</hi> who having performed their Devotions, and received the Patriarch's Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, advanced ſo ſoon as it was Day with their Artillery; with which having plaid for ſome time upon the Entry, they afterwards fell palmall upon thoſe that Guarded them, by whom they were warmly received and repulſed twice: <hi>Gama,</hi> who little expected to have met with ſuch a ſtout Reſiſtance, was much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to ſee his Men beat off ſo; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs reſolving ſince he had begun it, either to carry his Point,

               <p>
                  <hi>Gama</hi> ſo ſoon as he was abſolute Maſter of the Place, ſent down one to wiſh the Empreſs Joy of it; and to deſire her, to do her Mountain <hi>Amba Camet</hi> the honour to viſit it, aſſuring her that ſhe might now ſafely do it;
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57883:78"/>there being not one <hi>Mahometan</hi> left alive upon it; the Empreſs was over-joy'd at the News, and having magnified the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Valour and Conduct beyond meaſure, ſhe returned her Thanks to <hi>Gama</hi> for the great Service he had done her Son in reducing ſuch a ſtrong Place, but deſired to be excuſed from viſiting of it: For beſides that it was very ſteep, ſhe had not courage enough to behold the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſes it muſt be covered withal.

She gave the Government of the Mountain to a Captain that was in her train, whoſe Anceſtors had formerly been Governors of it.</p>
               <p>The Camp continued near this Mountain all the Month of <hi>February,</hi> for the ſake of the wounded men; during which time, <hi>Gama</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Meſſage brought by two <hi>Portugueſes</hi> from <hi>Manuel de Vaſconſelho,</hi> who had been ſent by the Viceroy with Five Ships, to learn where the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Galleys were, and with a freſh Supply of Arms and Ammunition. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this advice <hi>Gama</hi> ſent <hi>Franciſco Velho</hi> with a Guard of 40 <hi>Portugueſes</hi> well armed and mounted, to <hi>Matzua,</hi> where <hi>Vaſconſelho</hi> was with his Fleet, with an Order to receive the Arms and Ammunition that was ſent to him by his Brother; to whom he gave a full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57883:79"/>by Letter, of the State of Affairs in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and of all that he had done in it.

But they had not been many days in theſe good Quarters, before <hi>Gama</hi> received Letters from the Emperor, deſiring him to march towards him with all the haſte he could, he being informed that <hi>Granhe</hi> had reſolved to get betwixt them with an Army, which neither of them alone could be able to deal with.</p>
               <p>Upon this Advice <hi>Gama</hi> made long Marches to have got to the Emperor,

                     </note> for which, tho he well deſerved to be chaſtiſed, to diſcourage others from making ſuch mad Adventures; yet conſidering he was but a Boy, and had been wheedled into it by the Empreſs, who was certainly the falſeſt Woman in the world; he was ready not only to pardon him, but to convey him and his men ſafe back to their Ships; deſiring him withal to accept of the Preſent he had ſent him, which was a Monk's Cowl, and a Roſary of Beads, as much more proper for him than a Sword and Armour. Gama</hi> treated the Meſſenger civilly, preſenting him with a Silk Veſt and a Medal, bidding him tell his Maſter,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57883:79"/>That he ſhould have an Anſwer from him in a day or two.</p>
               <p>A Council of War having been called thereupon, it was agreed that <hi>Gama</hi> ſhould return the following Anſwer to <hi>Granhe, That he was ſent into</hi> Ethiopia <hi>by the great Lyon of the Sea, and the moſt powerful Lord of the Earth, whoſe cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom it was to ſuccor all that are in diſtreſs; and who having been informed that the moſt Chriſtian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of</hi> Ethiopia, <hi>his Brother in Arms, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, and in a manner driven out of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire by Infidels, and the Enemies of the holy Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith, had ſent him with ſome Troops to reſtore him to his Empire, which tho they were but few in number, yet he did not doubt but they were enough to fight the greateſt Armies of one who had been ſo wicked, as without any reaſon or colour of Juſtice, to diſpoſſeſs a Prince of his Empire, and that not with his own ſtrength, but becauſe the true God was pleaſed to permit it to be ſo for the chaſtiſement of the Sins of the</hi> Habaſſins, <hi>whoſe Wrath he hoped was now abundantly ſatisfied with what they had already ſuffered, ſo that he would now in his great mercy reſtore them again to their Ancient Liberties, and give them the Lands of their Forefathers, of which he had ſo unjuſtly robbed them.</hi> With this Anſwer he ſent him a <hi>large Looking-glaſs with a pair of Pinchers, ſuch as Women uſe.
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gama</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns <hi>Granhe</hi> a Meſſage, with a Preſent no leſs huffing than ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous.</note> Granhe</hi> though deſperate mad at this Anſwer and Preſent, yet could not forbear ſaying, <hi>That Captains who had the courage to fight Armies with handfuls of men, deſerved to have great honours done them by all Princes:</hi> But perceiving the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> were not to be perſuaded to lay down their Arms, he thought the beſt way to deal with

               <p>But the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> after having beſieged <hi>Gama</hi> at a diſtance for ſome days, being aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of taking ſuch a courſe with a Body of men, which they reckoned would not be a Breakfaſt to them, did oblige <hi>Granhe</hi> to change his Meaſures, and to lead them up to the Enemy, whom when they came near, they found ſtrongly encamped.

                  <hi>Granhe</hi> finding the Enemy thus poſted, and being neither willing to diſcourage his Men by marching back again, nor to hazard them by making an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, ordered a Breaſt-work to be run up within Musket-ſhot of them, from behind which he for ſome day mauled the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> with his Fire-Arms; <hi>Gama,</hi> whoſe number could not long endure this ſport, reſolved whatever it coſt him, next night to diſlodge the Infidels, which with the help of his Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery he did in a few hours, obliging them to keep their former diſtance, which was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Cannon Shot of his Camp, in which Action he had ſeveral wounded, but not one killed.

               <p>After this <hi>Gama</hi> was more at eaſe for the preſent; yet being ſenſible that this would not do his buſineſs, the Enemy, as they lay, keeeping him from ſupplies of Proviſions, he was forced to decamp, which he did before day, and in very good order, bringing up the Rear himſelf.</p>

               <p>The Infidels perceiving ſo ſoon as it was light, that the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> had left their Camp, purſued them with great fury, reckoning now they had got them upon plain ground, to have made ſhort work with them.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Gama,</hi> when they were come near him, plied them ſo with his Artillery, that he made them retreat in diſorder, leaving ſeveral of their beſt men dead, or wounded, behind them, <hi>Granhe</hi> himſelf having his Horſe ſhot under him, and receiving a wound in his Thigh with a Musket-bullet; there were 11 <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſes,</hi> one of whom was an Enſign, killed in this Action, and ſeveral wounded; <hi>Gama</hi> himſelf having received a ſlight wound in the Leg; who having lain ſtill 12 days to cure his wounded men, and obſerved that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my had reſumed his firſt method of ſtarving them, he determined to fall upon them in their Quarters, which he did with good ſucceſs, driving them from their Poſts, and making a great ſlaughter among them; in this Attack <hi>Gama</hi> loſt 14 more of his <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> beſides two that were blown up by a Barrel of Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, which took fire by accident; the noiſe of which was of no ſmall advantage to him, the Enemies Horſes being put into ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order therewith, that the Officers were not able to bring them together again; he had likewiſe 70 wounded, two whereof died of their Wounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Granhe</hi> finding there was no breaking this Body of <hi>Portugueſes</hi> by reaſon of their Diſcipline and Artillery,

               <p>
                  <hi>Gama</hi> having thus rid himſelf of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, removed his Camp to the Banks of a large and pleaſant River, where he had been but two days, when the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> he had ſent to <hi>Matzua</hi> returned to him, but without bringing any thing of that they were ſent for, the Ships that brought the Arms and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition having been frighted away before they got to <hi>Matzua,</hi> by ſome Intelligence they had received of a Fleet of <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Gallies ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king towards them. <hi>Bahurnagays</hi> likewiſe came back to him at the ſame time with a Body of 500 <hi>Habaſſin</hi> Foot and 30 Horſe.</p>

               <p>While <hi>Gama</hi> was in theſe quarters, a certain <hi>Jew,</hi> who was Governor of a ſtrong Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain called <hi>Oaty,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Cemen,</hi> came to wait on him, and to let him know, That in the neighbouring Mountains there were great numbers of curious Horſes which were but weakly guarded, offering if he would ſend any of his men to ſeize them, to be their Guide himſelf; he further told him,
<note place="margin">

She told him frankly, <hi>That ſhe thought it was but too true;</hi> hereupon he determined to go, and either make himſelf Maſter of thoſe Horſes and Paſſes, or die in the Attempt. In purſuance of which reſolution, that he might not alarm <hi>Granhe,</hi> he marched ſecretly out of his Camp by night with a 100 of his <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſes,</hi> and never halted till he came to the great River <hi>Tavaze,</hi> over which he was forced to waft his men upon <hi>Boracho's,</hi> or Hides full of Wind; but what was worſt of all, when they came near the Mountain his deſign was upon, he found the Gariſon much ſtronger

               </p>
               <p>Theſe Foreign Troops came up to <hi>Granhe</hi> the very night that <hi>Gama</hi> returned to the Camp;

               <p>But the Emperor, as he abſolutely denied his having ever made any ſuch promiſe, ſo he conjured the Patriarch not to trouble him any more about his Religion, being reſolved never to change it for that of Popery, which he called <hi>Neſtorianiſm,</hi> and accuſed of <hi>worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Four Gods;</hi>

               <p>The Patriarch finding he was not to be perſuaded to embrace Popery, was for trying whether he could not terrify him into it, by obliging the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> by his Cenſures, not to ſerve him any longer until he made profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it.</p>
               <p>The Emperor is ſaid at firſt to have laughed at this Excommunication, as the effect of the impotent Paſſion of an angry old man, who would needs be exerciſing juriſdiction where he had none; and it is more than probable, conſidering his preſent Circumſtances, and the ſmall number the <hi>Pertugueſes</hi> were then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to, that he continued to do ſo to the laſt: Notwithſtanding it is reported, That when he found the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> would ſerve him no longer, unleſs he declared himſelf a

               <p>But however that were, it is certain, that the Emperor at this time did not only declare, That he would <hi>never ſubmit himſelf and his Empire to the Pope,</hi> who beſides that he was a <hi>Neſtorian</hi> Heretick, had nothing to do with a Church, which from its very firſt foundation had been all along ſubject to the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria;</hi> but to ſhew the World that he was in earneſt, he writ to the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria</hi> to ſend an <hi>Abuna</hi> into <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> according to the cuſtom of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors.</p>

               <p>The Emperor, now he had rid himſelf of the Popiſh Patriarch, who would never let him be quiet day nor night with his Religion, began to expreſs great kindneſs again to all the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> that remained, employing ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of them about his Perſon, and giving ſuch Eſtates to the reſt, that there was not one of them but what kept his Horſe or Mule, and lived with the Equipage of a Gentleman; inſomuch that there was but one hard thing whereof they could accuſe the Emperor,

               <p>The <hi>Bulls</hi> of the <hi>three Elects</hi> being come to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> the King looking upon it as the greateſt honour that had ever been done to <hi>Portugal</hi> to have a Patriarch conſecrated in it,
<note place="margin">The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch, and one of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adjutors, are Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated at <hi>Lisbon.</hi>
                  </note> made great Preparations for that Ceremony; the Patriarch, and the Biſhop of <hi>Hieropolis,</hi> were both conſecrated in the Church of the <hi>Trinity Friars</hi> by <hi>Don Julian d'Abreu,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Portalegree,</hi> and <hi>Dom Gaſper</hi> Biſhop of the Iſland of St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> and <hi>Dom Peter</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Hippo; Melchior</hi> Elect of <hi>Nice,</hi> having Sailed from <hi>Lisbon</hi> for the <hi>Indies</hi> four days before the arrival of the <hi>Bulls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding the King and the whole Court honoured this Conſecration with their preſence, yet I do not find that any of <hi>the great Prelates</hi> of the Kingdom were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at it; which, together with its not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been performed in <hi>the See Church,</hi> but in the Chappel of a Convent, and that by
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:57883:92"/>two Titulars, and the Pooreſt Biſhop in <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> makes me ſuſpect that the great Prelates were not over-well pleaſed with this upſtart Order leaping ſo ſoon into ſuch high Dignities.</p>
               <p>For about the time of this Promotion, and which it is like enough might contribute ſomething towards it, there was a moſt terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtorm raiſed both in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the whole Order of the <hi>Jeſuits.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Don John,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Toledo,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Jeſuits leaping ſo quickly into ſuch high dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, contrary to their Vows, creates them Enemies.</note> who conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued a mortal Enemy to it till his death, driving them out of the <hi>Univerſity of</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletum <hi>in the year</hi> 1555, <hi>and prohibiting all his Prieſts, upon pain of Deprivation, to make uſe of any of their Exerciſes; and prohibiting all others, upon pain of Excommunication, to confeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to any of them.</hi> The <hi>Sorbon</hi> likewiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared about the ſame time, <hi>That the Society of Jeſus was dangerous to the Faith, a diſturber of the Peace of the Church, pernicious to Monaſtical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and, in a word, was for Deſtruction, and not for Edification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There were two things, one would think, might have been ſome rubs in the way of this promotion, though we do not find they were in the leaſt.</p>
               <p>The firſt was, That there was a Patriarch, and one of the Pope's own Confirming, then living in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> of whom we ſhall hear more hereafter.</p>
               <p>The ſecond was, the Vow that is taken by the Jeſuits, never directly nor indirectly to ſeek after any Eccleſiaſtical Promotion, either
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:57883:93"/>within or without their Order; which they had violated with a witneſs, in ſeeking after a Miſſion of this nature, which was not to be performed without ſome high Prelates. Neither do we any where read, that <hi>Ignatius,</hi> when he laboured ſo hard to get his Friars employed therein, did deſire only the Miniſtry of it for them, leaving the Prelacy thereof to ſuch as were under no Vows to the contrary.</p>
               <p>But however the Clergy ſtood affected, the King was extreamly pleaſed with this Promotion, and preſented the Patriarch with extraordinary rich Veſtments, and with a noble ſet of Plate for his own Altar; all which, upon this Miſſion miſcarrying, was afterwards given by King <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> to the Jeſuits College at <hi>Goa,</hi> where the Patriarch had lodged it.</p>
               <p>The Patriarch, by reaſon of his <hi>Bulls</hi> not having come till ſome days after the <hi>India</hi> Fleet departed, was obliged to wait a year for the next Fleet;
<note place="margin">The King of <hi>Portugal</hi> wiſely ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting that things were not ſo ripe in <hi>Ethiopia</hi> as they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to be, ſends an Envoy for true Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</note> during which time he lived for the moſt part at St. <hi>Rocks,</hi> the Houſe of the profeſſed Jeſuits at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> of whoſe Chappel he laid the firſt Stone.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding it was generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved both at <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Lisbon,</hi> that the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſin</hi> Church and Empire were as good as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to the Pope; yet there did not want ſome ſober Heads at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> who doubted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all things were ſo well in <hi>Ethiopia</hi> as they were reported to be, and as it is plain the Pope and <hi>Ignatius</hi> thought they were; the former in his Bull, calling the Emperor his
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:57883:93"/>
                  <hi>Beloved Son,</hi> and the latter calling him his <hi>Lord in Chriſt,</hi> in his long Letter that he writ to him, and in a ſtyle as if he had been a ſecond <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> This Letter of <hi>Ignatius</hi> is ſet down at length by <hi>Maffeus,</hi> and all the other Writers of his Life, in which there are but two things that are remarkable; the one is, his quoting the Firſt Council of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> for <hi>the Authoritative Supremacy of the Pope;</hi> whereas thoſe Councils do place the <hi>Pope's primacy of Order,</hi> which was all they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, on a bottom that quite deſtroys the <hi>Florentine</hi> Supremacy, founding it purely upon <hi>the Secular conſideration, of Old</hi> Rome <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt City in the</hi> Roman <hi>Empire.</hi> And the ſecond is, his proving from Pope <hi>Marcellus</hi>'s Decretal Epiſtle, which is acknowledged by all Learned Roman-Catholicks to have been a Spurious Brat of the Eighth or Ninth Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, That God did expreſly <hi>command St.</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>to fix his See at</hi> Rome.</p>
               <p>But to return to the thread of my Story.</p>
               <p>The King having been made jealous by ſome of his Miniſters, that <hi>Ethiopia</hi> might not be altogether ſo well diſpoſed to ſubmit it ſelf to the Pope, as was commonly believed, gave Orders to <hi>Don Peter Maſcarenhas,</hi> who Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Fleet that Sailed for the <hi>Indies</hi> four days before the coming of the Pope's <hi>Bulls</hi> to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> ſo ſoon as he arrived at <hi>Goa,</hi> to diſpatch an Envoy thither to bring certain tidings of the preſent ſtate of its Affairs; who accordingly ſo ſoon as he was arrived
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:57883:94"/>at <hi>Goa,</hi> ſent one <hi>James Dias Opreſtes,</hi> joyning Father <hi>Gancalre Rodriguez,</hi> a Jeſuit, with him, into <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> to bring Intelligence how mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſtood there; this Jeſuits chief, if not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly buſineſs in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> as we ſhall ſee here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, was, if he found the Patriarch <hi>Bermu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> alive, to fetch him off, to make a clear ſtage for his Succeſſor; ſince it would not have looked well to have had two <hi>Popiſh</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs together in <hi>Ethiopia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Envoys ſailed from <hi>Goa</hi> in <hi>February</hi> 1555, and in 30 days landed ſafe at <hi>Arkiko,</hi> where having reſted themſelves for ſome time, they continued their Journey by Land till they came to the place where their old Friend <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurnagays</hi> reſided, who having received them with great kindneſs, ſent them with a good Convoy to the Court. But</p>
               <p>The Jeſuit <hi>Rodriguez</hi> having given the World a very particular relation of all this Negotiation at the <hi>Habaſſin</hi> Court, I ſhall ſet it down word for word as he reports it.</p>
               <p>On the 26th.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rodriguez</hi> the Jeſuit, who went with the Envoy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra,</hi> his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Voyage and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation.</note> of <hi>May</hi> we came to the King of <hi>Ethiopia</hi>'s Court, which is nothing but a Camp full of Tents; the King was pleaſed to give us a publick Audience the ſecond day after our Arrival, into whoſe preſence when we were introduced, we found him ſeated in a Chair hung round with Silk Curtains, as indeed the whole Tent was, the Floor of the Room being covered with a rich Carpet. <hi>James Dias</hi> having delivered our Letters to the King, he Commanded them to be Read in the hearing of all the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> that belonged
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:57883:94"/>the Court, who were all permitted to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the Ceremony. In which Letters our Lord the King having acquainted him with his intention of ſending one of his Courtiers, with a certain number of Friars of Good lives and found Doctrine next year to him; the King when he heard that, was all of a ſudden in a great diſorder, and had his thoughts ſo taken up with it, that when we ſpoke to him, he never returned us any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that was to the purpoſe, but diſmiſſed us to return to our Tents. Within two or three days after this Audience, the King took a Progreſs to viſit his Grandmother, who lived at a place that was Eight or Ten days Journey from the Camp, in which he left us, without having given any order about our Entertainment, and without ſending us ſo much as any thing of a Complement: So that I do not know what would have become of us, had not an honourable <hi>Portugueſe</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried us to his Houſe, which was Two or Three Leagues from the Camp, and Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained us there till the King returned, which he did not in a Month.</p>
               <p>During that time I compoſed a Treatiſe of the Errors of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and of the Truth of our Holy Faith, with an intention to have preſented it to the King; who, as I was told by a <hi>Potugueſe</hi> that was much in his Favour, had no kindneſs for the <hi>Roman Pontiff,</hi> and had ſaid openly, <hi>That he ſtood in no need of the Friars the King of</hi> Portugal <hi>was ſo forward to ſend him, being fully reſolved never to ſubmit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the</hi> Roman Church.</p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:57883:95"/>
               <p>I was informed likewiſe by all the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſes</hi> of the Court, That ſeveral of the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees had been heard to ſay,
<note place="margin">An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>Habaſſin</hi> Zeal againſt Popery.</note> 
                  <hi>That they would ſooner put themſelves under the</hi> Mahometans, <hi>than turn</hi> Papiſts: This put me upon writing all that I could have Preached to them, if I could have ſpoke their Language, that ſo I might by the anſwer the King returned to it, clearly diſcover his thoughts which he had ſo long diſſembled: when we heard of the King's being returned to the Camp, we went preſently to wait upon him, and were told by ſeveral <hi>Portugueſes</hi> that belonged to the Court, That the King had not ſo much as once men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned our Names ſince our Audience.</p>
               <p>Now the Treatiſe I had compoſed being in <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> it was neceſſary if I would have the King to read it, to get it Tranſlated into <hi>Chaldee;</hi> whereupon I writ a Letter to the King himſelf, to deſire him to let me have a couple of Learned Monks to Tranſlate the Truths of our Faith into <hi>Chaldee,</hi> I having put them together on purpoſe to ſhew how little reaſon his people had to call us of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, <hi>Hereticks;</hi> and to affirm that we were worſe than <hi>Mahometans;</hi> and being informed that the <hi>Habaſſins</hi> had a Book among them, written by the <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> and <hi>Hereticks</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> from whence they have their <hi>Abuna</hi>'s, having paid a Tribute to the <hi>Turk</hi> for that priviledge, Entituled, <hi>The Adultery of the</hi> Franks; wherein, among other things, the Council of <hi>Calcedon</hi> is condemned, pretending that it taught that there were Four Perſons in the Holy Trinity; and we are
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:57883:95"/>likewiſe charged with divers Errors, I begg'd of the King that I might have a ſight of that Book.</p>
               <p>The King would not let me have the Book, and was very angry that I had been told of it; but as to the Monks I had deſired, he order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a couple to come to me, but they had not well begun the Tranſlation, before either out of fear that the King would be diſpleaſed with them if they went on with it, or becauſe he had privately Commanded them not to do it, they gave it over; ſo that I was obliged to repair to a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Captain to ſpeak to them to finiſh it; who with much ado pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with them to go on: The Interpreter on my ſide was a worthy <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood both the Languages well.</p>
               <p>Having at laſt got my Treatiſe Tranſlated, the next thing I had to do, was to get it writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten out fair, and having deſired an Amanuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis of the King to do it for me, after having granted me one, he repented preſently, and ſent me word, That if I would let him ſee my Treatiſe as it was, he would read it over, and that otherwiſe he would never trouble himſelf with it; ſo I was obliged to carry it to him as it was, having firſt dated it, and put my name to it; it bore date the 20th. of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt.</hi> When I delivered it to him, I was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Captain, and Seven or Eight more of the ſame Nation: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having paid the cuſtomary Obeiſances, I began a ſhort ſpeech concerning the occaſion of my coming into <hi>Ethiopia;</hi> but the King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted me, and began to talk of other
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:57883:96"/>things, as one prepared to ward off the blows that I had deſigned to have given him; when I had put my Treatiſe into his hand, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to read in it, but had read but a little way, before he was put into ſuch a paſſion by it, as made him vomit out the poiſon he had ſo long concealed, telling me, I had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired leave to ſet down the Truths of my own Faith, and to have ſome Monks to Tranſlate them into <hi>Chaldee,</hi> but inſtead of that, I had charged thoſe with Errors who had none; he told me further, That that was a work no ways proper for a ſimple Prieſt, like me, but was the work of ſome Great Biſhop, or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, like the Pope. I made anſwer, It was true I was but a mean man, but the things I had ſet down were nevertheleſs the Truths of the Goſpel, and of the Holy Councils, whom, and not me, I deſired his Highneſs to hear. He told me, I had impoſed ſeveral things up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them which they never held. I replied, I knew very well that his Highneſs was in no Error of Faith, but that his Subjects were; and that I had ſet down nothing but what was true, and what I was ready to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to him. He ſaid, He was no friend to Diſputations, but there was one thing he was certain of, which was that <hi>Ethiopia</hi> had always held the ſame Faith that it did now, or at leaſt that it had for above a Thouſand years; that Diſputations were never to be uſed but with <hi>Heathens,</hi> and that his Faith being thus Ancient, there was no body before me had ever preſumed to ſay it was Erroneous.</p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:57883:96"/>
               <p>To this I anſwered, That God did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for peoples Sins ſuffer ſuch things, and that his Highneſs had reaſon to thank God, for having in his time viſited <hi>Ethiopia</hi> with the truth of the Goſpel: He ſaid the Catholick Church was divided into four Chairs, and that they had from the beginning been ſubject to one of them: I repli'd, it was true, but ſo it was likewiſe, that all Churches were Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſubject to the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhop, who was above all the reſt, as his Highneſs was above his Subjects; inſomuch that the three other Chairs for having denied obedience to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> were all become Schiſmatical, together with all thoſe who were ſubject to them; That his Highneſs if he would be pleaſed to peruſe my Treatiſe, would therein meet with full Anſwers to all his Objections, exhorting him to take care not to make himſelf of that number of People the Prophet ſpeaks of, who would not underſtand, that they might do well.
<note place="margin">The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of himſelf and his Faith.</note> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a great deal of arguing, I told him that my deſign in writing that Paper, was to diſcover how his mind ſtood diſpoſed towards the Pope, and the Learned Friars which his Brother the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> was about to ſend to him; for that if he was not willing that they ſhould come, it would be to no purpoſe for the King to ſend them ſo far; I did therefore beſeech his Highneſs to declare whether he intended to ſubmit himſelf to the Pope as he had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; he ſaid he had learned Friars enough in his Kingdom, and that it was needleſs for the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> to trouble himſelf to ſend him any more; and as for the Pope, That he had
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:57883:97"/>never yielded him any obedience; that Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that was carried to him, by <hi>Gaſper de Magalhaens,</hi> being what he had never made, and was either a trick or miſtake of the Monk who Tranſlated his Letters to the King of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal;</hi> concluding, That he was reſolved never to yield Obedience to any Patriarch, but the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> whom he would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways obey, as all his Anceſtors had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. When I found the King thus abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely determined, I took my leave of him; who after I was gone, begun to extol me for a mighty Scholar, ſaying, <hi>He wondered how it was poſſible for ſo young a man to have attained to ſo great a ſtock of Learning:</hi> I was told like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that he read my Treatiſe over, and that after he had once read it, it was ſeldom out of his Hand, and that he was ſtill ſhewing it to his Mother, and Brothers, and the Grandees of the Court; and that upon the <hi>Abuna</hi>'s ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving denounced an Excommunication againſt all that ſhould read it, the King had ſent to him for leave to read it again, and was put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch a Paſſion, by the <hi>Abuna</hi>'s having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd it to him, that he called him <hi>Mahometan,</hi> and <hi>Heretick,</hi> ſaying, <hi>He would read the</hi> Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran <hi>of</hi> Mahomet <hi>himſelf, and at the ſame time not give him leave to read a godly Book;</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding him thereupon ſince he was their <hi>Abuna,</hi> to anſwer a Book that was written by a poor Clerk who had no Dignity: To which the <hi>Abuna</hi>'s anſwer was, <hi>That he did not come into</hi> Ethiopia <hi>to diſpute, but to confer holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:57883:97"/>
               <p>The Court however being divided about this Affair, ſome ſeeming to favour the <hi>Roman,</hi> but moſt, and eſpecially the Queen-Mother, and all her Creatures ſtickling for the <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi> Faith; the King reſolved to call together ſome of the moſt Learned among his Monks, to have their Opinion in the matter; and in order thereunto he commanded my Treatiſe to be Tranſlated into <hi>Habaſſin,</hi> leaving out thoſe Paſſages he was diſpleaſed with when he firſt looked into it; namely, that where I ſpoke of the Pope St. <hi>Leo,</hi> and of <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> whom they reckon a Saint, as they do <hi>Leo,</hi> to be Excommunicated and Accurſed, and for whom they have ſuch a deteſtation, that they cannot endure ſo much as to have him named, rejecting the Council of <hi>Calcedon</hi> and its Decrees, which they ſay er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Faith, in condemning St. <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> as they unjuſtly Stile him: Since which time they have always been ſeparated from the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church, having now for 1067 years been involved in the Hereſy of <hi>Sergius, Paulus,</hi> and <hi>Pyrhus,</hi> who were all condemned in the Sixth Council of <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> and in that of <hi>Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> likewiſe, which holds that there is but one nature in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The time being come when I was to receive the King's Anſwer, I ſent to know when I ſhould wait upon him; he ſent me back word, his Father's Embaſſador waited Ten years in <hi>Portugal</hi> before he could be diſpatched. I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by this the King was for entertaining me with delays, on purpoſe to keep me from returning with the Fleet which waited for us,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:57883:98"/>for fear leaſt we might diſcover the weakneſs of his Empire to them; and ſo when I went to have my Conge from him, in order to my returning to <hi>Debora,</hi> he commanded one to tell me, That ſo great a man as I was, and who had come ſo far, was not to be diſmiſſed quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: Beſides, that I could go no where, where I could do ſo much good, as where I was, in confeſſing the <hi>Portugueſes;</hi> nevertheleſs if I was reſolved not to remain in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> he would then deſire me only to wait a month longer for his Anſwer; and if I did not receive it then, I might look upon my ſelf as diſmiſſed. Preſently after this he removed his Camp to a place that was two days journey from the place where it was; we followed the Camp; and being in the Field on <hi>Saturday</hi> and <hi>Sunday,</hi> we ſet up an Altar whereon we ſaid <hi>Maſs</hi> on both thoſe days, where I was viſited by three Monks, who deſired to have ſome Diſcourſe with me about Matters of Religion: One of them who was a Scholar, told me, <hi>That all that we did, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared well to him, excepting that of our not obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> Saturday, <hi>and that of our cating Hare and Swine's</hi> Fleſh. Nevertheleſs after this he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorged ſeveral Errors in Faith, namely, <hi>That the Souls when they leave the Body cannot preſently behold the Divine Eſſence, but are placed in a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial Paradiſe. That the Holy Spirit does not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the Son, but from the Father only. That the Son as to his Humanity was equal to the Father. That none but</hi> Mahometans <hi>and</hi> Infidels <hi>were damned eternally in Hell.</hi> I returned anſwers to all theſe Errors, and declared the contrary Truths to him, both from Scripture and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:57883:98"/>with which he was ſo fully ſatisfied, that whiſpering me in the Ear, that the two other Monks who were illiterate might not hear him, he ſaid, <hi>What I had told him was the truth, and that he believed it to be ſo in his heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Month being expired, I went to wait upon the King for his Anſwer, and for leave to return home; he bid <hi>me go in a good hour;</hi> and as for the Fathers the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> deſigned to ſend to him, he ſaid, <hi>He had appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one to wait at</hi> Matrua <hi>to receive them when they landed, being deſirous to hear what they had to ſay to him.</hi> With this I took my leave of him, and paſſing thorough the Countries where divers of the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> lived, I confeſſed them and their Families, and Married ſeveral of them to their Concubines, having firſt reduced them to our holy Faith. There was one among them who was nearly related to the King. And whereas the Churches of that Countrey, beſides that they belong to Schiſmaticks, have no Altars accommodated to our Service, whereever we went, we carried an Altar with us to celebrate on.</p>
               <p>While I was in one of theſe places, I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a Complement from a Prelate of a great Monaſtery of Monks of the Order of St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony,</hi> and one likewiſe from the Prelate of a Nunnery, which were two Leagues off. This Monaſtery of Monks is one of the biggeſt in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> it is called <hi>Debra Libanus,</hi> and is of ſuch Credit, that all the Faith of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon it in a manner; for which reaſon the Prelate thereof is in high Eſteem; I went to give him a Viſit, being attended by all the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:57883:99"/>
                  <hi>Portugueſes</hi> of the place, but he happened to be from home; we nevertheleſs took a view of the Monaſtery, which is no ways like ours, neither as to Building, nor as to their way of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; every Monk having his diſtinct Dwelling-Houſe and Land belonging to it, which he cultivates with his own Hands; ſo that the <hi>Habaſſin</hi> Monaſteries look like Villages, the Monks having their Houſes on one ſide of the Street, and the Nuns theirs on the other; but not being kept aſunder, the Nuns are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently troubled with Great Bellies.</p>
               <p>Theſe Monks are neither of the Order of St. <hi>Francis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">No menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driguez</hi> having ſeen the old Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch, tho his chief buſineſs in <hi>Ethiopia</hi> was to fetch him from thence, if he found him alive.</note> nor St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> but were founded by one <hi>Tecla Haymanot,</hi> that is, <hi>The Plant of the Faith,</hi> who was of the Order of St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony.</hi> This <hi>Haymanot</hi> is a great Saint among them, and is ſaid to have killed a prodigious Serpent that was worſhipped by the <hi>Heathens</hi> as a God, whom he converted by that means to the Faith that is ſtill taught in <hi>Ethiopia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much of <hi>Rodriguez</hi>'s Relation the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits have thought fit to make publick; in which, notwithſtanding there is not one word of the Patriarch <hi>Bermudes;</hi> yet that does not hinder it from having been <hi>Rodriguez</hi>'s chief if not only buſineſs in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> to fetch him from thence.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rodriguez</hi> frights the old Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch out of his Province, to make room for his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor.</note>
               </p>
               <p>For in a Letter of that Patriarch's, printed at <hi>Lisbon</hi> in the year 1568, it is ſaid, That Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Rodriguez</hi> was with him ſeveral days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he went to Court; and that when he returned from thence, he came to him again in a moſt deſperate fright, pretending he had narrowly eſcaped having been mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:57883:99"/>for having aſſerted the <hi>Roman</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines; adding, That it was a madneſs for any one to think of reducing <hi>Ethiopia</hi> to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, till the Heat they were in at preſent againſt it, was over.</p>
               <p>Now what can be the meaning of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits having ſo induſtriouſly ſuppreſſed all this; <hi>Rodriguez</hi>'s Relation, as they have printed it, beginning immediately after his having left the Patriarch, and breaking off abruptly juſt before he returned to him again; but that they were not willing that the world ſhould know that the firſt Prelate of their Order was an Uſurper,
<note place="margin">The firſt Prelate of the Jeſuits Order was an Uſut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</note> and that they were forc'd to make uſe of art, to vacate a Province for him; which, as it was no good beginning, ſo their <hi>Ethiopick</hi> Miſſions, as we ſhall ſee here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, ſucceeded accordingly. Beſides, what other deſign could <hi>Rodriguez</hi> have in pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to return to the Patriarch in ſuch a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal fright, as if he had narrowly eſcaped ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been murthered for defending the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, which according to his own relation was falſe; and in repreſenting the Reduction of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> to him as a thing not to be thought of? but only to fright him away, which it did. For by that means <hi>Rodriguez</hi> carried him with him to <hi>Goa,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The old Patriarch was lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Jeſuits College in <hi>Goa.</hi>
                  </note> where he lodged him in the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits College; a Civility, that Order ſeldom or never pays to any Foreigner that they have not ſome deſign upon; where after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving kept him a Year, they embarked him for <hi>Lisbon,</hi> not taking any notice of his ever ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeen or ſpoke with his Succeſſor, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they were for ſome Months to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether

                  </note> the Jeſuits know beſt by what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, was dropt in the Voyage, in the ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Iſland of St. <hi>Helena;</hi> where after having done Penance a Year, which was long enough, any one would have thought, to have ſent ſuch an old man into the next world, he met with an opportunity of proceeding on his Voyage, and in the year 1558, arrived ſafe at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> where he lived ſome years after, never reſigning his Patriarchate, but with his laſt breath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tellez</hi> the Jeſuit apprehending that this Blot of their firſt Prelate's having been an Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, might at ſome time or other come to be hit, has endeavoured to cover it, by affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Bermudes</hi> was never Patriarch of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> but of <hi>Alexandria;</hi> for which he quotes both a Treatiſe of his own, and his Tombſtone in the Church of St. <hi>Sebaſtian Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreiro</hi> in <hi>Lisbon,</hi> in both which, ſaith <hi>Tellez,</hi> he is ſtiled Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria:</hi> But if this be not to cut a knot that he is not able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye, nothing is ſo; for beſides that all the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians of his time ſpeak of him ſtill as Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> all of them, the Jeſuits not excepted, agreeing that the Pope gave <hi>Bermu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> no new Orders or Title, but only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd thoſe that had been conferr'd on him by the <hi>Abuna</hi> and Emperor of <hi>Ethiopia;</hi> who it is certain did never pretend to make a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> It is a Jeſt for any one to think that the Pope would beſtow the ſecond Title in the Church upon an obſcure Itinerant, and who was ordained <hi>per ſaltum</hi> by a ſingle <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Biſhop.</p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:57883:100"/>
               <p>As to <hi>Tellez</hi>'s two Authorities for <hi>Bermudes</hi> having been Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> all that can be ſaid to them is, That if there be any ſuch things, they muſt have been foiſted into thoſe Monuments, by thoſe who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to have him paſs for Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and not of <hi>Ethiopia:</hi> Tho by the way, it is ſomewhat ſtrange, that <hi>Tellez,</hi> who lived moſt of his time within a Mile of the Church of St. <hi>Sebaſtian Pedreira,</hi> ſhould not quote that Tombſtone upon his own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but upon the Authority of a Book. Farthermore, ſuppoſing <hi>Bermudes</hi> to have had the Title of <hi>Alexandria</hi> given him by the Pope, that does not hinder but that he might have been <hi>Abuna</hi> of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> too; it being the Pope's common practice to confer the <hi>Oriental</hi> Patriarchates upon Prelates that are poſſeſſed of other great Biſhopricks: So Cardinal <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niface</hi> was Biſhop of <hi>Tuſculum,</hi> and Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Cajetanus</hi> was Archbiſhop of <hi>Capua,</hi> and Patriarch of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och:</hi> And I do not believe there is one Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent for the Popes having ever conferred any of thoſe high Titles upon any Prelate that had not another Biſhoprick.</p>
               <p>Finally, <hi>Pius</hi> the IVth, during the time <hi>Bermudes</hi> was Patriarch, treated with <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> about his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to him as Patriarch of that See: The Hiſtory of which Treaty, as not being fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign to my purpoſe, I ſhall here ſet down.</p>

As to Baptiſm, I ſaid there was no ſuch thing, I having been Baptized when I was but Eight days old; but as to the Euchariſt, it was true, that being once dangerouſly ſtick, I had deſired it, which was a thing I thought I might lawfully do, in the extream neceſſity I was in at that time; and that I would do it again if there were the ſame oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and could not have the opportunity of a</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Prieſt.</hi> He told me, <hi>he would order it not to be given to me; St.</hi> Paul <hi>having ſaid,</hi> there is but one Faith and one Baptiſm: To that I repli'd, <hi>If St.</hi> Paul <hi>ſaith ſo, why is your Highneſs Baptized once a year?</hi> This put him into a great Paſſion; and having given me a great many hard words, he put his Hand to his Sword; which I having obſerved, I ſaid to him, Sir, <hi>I would not have your Highneſs defer puniſhing me; for, for this Truth of the good Jeſus, I do not fear all the Kings of the Earth, nor none but him, whom we deſire not to chaſten us in his wrath: but for you, I would have you to chaſten me in your anger; for as there is nothing ſo excellent as the Soul, ſo Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard nothing that is not Infinite.

                     <p>
                        <hi>SUch as are in Office have two ways of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the one is as in their own Perſon, and the other as in the Poſt they are in. So that tho as to what concerns their own Perſons, they ought to be humble and patient when they are contradicted, as
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:57883:108"/>our Lord himſelf was when he was upon earth both in his Life and Death; nevertheleſs as to what concerns their Office and Embaſſy, they muſt ſpeak the truth, without reſpect of perſons, as Chriſt did when he anſwered the Preſident in a matter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his Father's Honour was concerned. What I have to tell your Highneſs as a Publick Perſon, is to lay before you the buſineſs that brought me into</hi> Ethiopia; <hi>with which notwithſtanding your Highneſs has been already acquainted both by Letter and by other ways, I do now tell you again, That I come from</hi> Rome, <hi>being ſent by the Pope to be Coadjutor to the Patriarch who is now in the</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, <hi>with whoſe Authority I am inveſted; that, as our caſe is at preſent, being what his Holineſs was pleaſed to beſtow upon me, as appears from a Bull that I have brought with me, and which your Highneſs may ſee when you pleaſe; I do intend there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at preſent to give an account of my having been ſent hither by the Pope, and of what moved his Holineſs to ſend a Patriarch, with two Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Coadjutors, and ſeveral Jeſuits of great Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Piety, into</hi> Ethiopia. <hi>When the Pope ſends a Legat or Patriarch to any Kingdom, he does not pretend thereby to make it his own, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can he ſell ſuch Dignities, for that would be Simony; but he is always moved thereunto merely by the proſpect of doing good to their Souls, as Chriſt hath commanded him in the Goſpel, bidding him</hi> Feed his Sheep: <hi>And it was thus in our preſent caſe, wherein the Pope, without having any temporal view, but purely for the ſervice of Chriſt, and the ſpiritual good of theſe Kingdoms, has done your Highneſs this Favour, being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto moved, both by the great love he hath for
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:57883:108"/>your Highneſs, and for all Chriſtian Kings, who are many in number, and are all much concerned for your Highneſs, and the Grandeur of your State, having a great affection for you, and by the good deſires and diſpoſition he was informed were in this Empire, and which he had a mind to improve. Now your Highneſs is to take notice, that theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives are things of great moment, and no ſlight mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters betwixt ſuch Eminent Perſons. Your Father writ a Letter to the Pope, a Copy whereof I my ſelf have ſeen at</hi> Rome, <hi>wherein he did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his Holineſs to be Chriſt's Vicar, deſiring him to ſend him ſome of his Learned Men: And beſides, the King of</hi> Portugal, <hi>who is a Prince of great Truth, ſaid in my hearing, That your Highneſs had writ to him, that your Father had command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you never to ſuffer any</hi> Abuna <hi>or Patriarch to come into</hi> Ethiopia, <hi>but who ſhould be ſent from</hi> Rome; <hi>and that he was furthermore informed from hence, That your Highneſs had publickly yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Obedience to the Pope, which, notwithſtanding it was done during the War,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Your Highneſs muſt therefore let me have your Anſwer to what I have deſired of you in his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs's Name, that I may take my meaſures accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly: And in caſe your Highneſs has any Scruples about Matters of Faith, you would then do well to call a Convocation of your Learned Men, whoſe Objections I ſhall endeavour to anſwer in the Name of Chriſt; for ſince the Faith of Chriſt is but one, as St.</hi> Paul <hi>ſaith in the</hi> 4th. <hi>Chapter to the</hi> Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, one God, one Faith, one Baptiſm, <hi>why ſhould there be any differences among Chriſtians? And why ſhould they not all agree in all Matters of Faith, ſo as to hold nothing that is contrary to the Goſpel of Chriſt? And if there is any thing wherein you think we are miſtaken, and will offer any reaſon for it either out of the Goſpel, or the General Councils of the Church, we ſhall be ready to follow the Truth; as on the other ſide, if you ſhould be made ſenſible of our being in no Error, you ought then together with us to follow the Truth of the Faith, according to what St.</hi> Paul <hi>ſaith in his firſt Chapter of his firſt Epiſtle to the</hi> Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, See that you all ſay the ſame things, that ſo there may be no Schiſms, and not to follow the cuſtoms of your forefathers, when they are contrary to the Truth. <hi>So when the Doctrine of Truth was preached by our Lord Chriſt to the</hi> Gentiles <hi>and</hi> Pagans, <hi>which he converted, ought not they to have received his Doctrines, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:57883:109"/>they were contrary to the Cuſtoms of their Anceſtors, and ſo have never believed in Chriſt, to their utter Perdition; neither is the known Truth to be forſaken for fear or ſhame of the World; for our Lord Chriſt hath ſaid,</hi> He that is aſhamed of me, and of my words, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> David <hi>likewiſe in the</hi> 94th Pſalm <hi>ſaith,</hi> To day, if you will hear his voice, <hi>&amp;c. Your Highneſs would do well, therefore, to conſider how much it imports you to take good Advice in an Affair of ſo high a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in which ſeeing all your People do depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, our Lord will call you to a ſtrict Account for their Souls. Conſider how dangerous a thing evil Councellors are, as appears from the Caſe of</hi> Rehoboam; <hi>and</hi> Jacob <hi>ſpeaking of ſuch, ſaid of</hi> Simeon <hi>and</hi> Judah, <hi>they were Veſſels of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> my Soul enter not into their councils; <hi>and</hi> David, <hi>They have taken evil Council againſt his People. And</hi> Iſaiah <hi>ſaith,</hi> The wiſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers of <hi>Pharoah</hi> have given fooliſh counſel; <hi>for which reaſon,</hi> Solomon <hi>in the</hi> 6th. <hi>of</hi> Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticus <hi>ſaith,</hi> Be in peace with mrny: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs have but one counſeller of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand. <hi>And in the firſt</hi> Pſalm, David <hi>ſaith,</hi> Bleſſed is the man that entereth not into the counſel of the wicked: <hi>furthermore Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and Relations are ſeldom good Counſellers in Spiritual Matters. As our Lord Chriſt told St.</hi> Peter <hi>in the</hi> 10th. <hi>of St.</hi> Matthew, Fleſh and blood, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> hath not revealed this unto thee. <hi>And the Prophet</hi> Micah <hi>in the 9th. Chapter ſaith,</hi> A man's enemies are thoſe of his own houſe. <hi>And in the</hi> 10th <hi>of St.</hi> Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, <hi>Chriſt ſaith,</hi> Think not that I came to
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:57883:110"/>bring peace on the earth: I tell you nay, but a ſword; for I came to ſet a man at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with his Father, and the Daughter with the Mother, and the Daughter-in-law with the Mother-in-law; and a man's enemies ſhall be thoſe of his own houſe; for he that loveth Father or Mother more than me, is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of me. <hi>And in the</hi> 12th. <hi>of St.</hi> Luke, <hi>he ſaith again,</hi> Think you that I came to bring peace upon the earth? <hi>And in the</hi> 14th. <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ſame Goſpel, he ſaith,</hi> If any man come to me, and hate not Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>&amp;c. From all which we may learn, That Parents and Relations are commonly Spiritual E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. Chriſt himſelf having ſaid,</hi> A man's enemies are thoſe of his own houſe, <hi>and that he came to divide the one from the other,</hi> and that whoſoever hateth not Father and Mother in ſuch caſes, cannot be his Diſciple. <hi>And what he taught others as to this matter, he confirmed by his own Example, when without asking his Holy Mothers advice, who undoubtedly would never have counſelled him to have done any thing that was amiſs; he remained diſputing in the Temple; and underſtanding his Mother had been in great Pain for him, and had been ſeeking after him, he made her anſwer, when ſhe told him of it,</hi> Wiſt you not that I muſt be about my Father's buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; <hi>intimating to us by this Carriage, That in Matters appertaining to God, we are not bound to adviſe with our Friends and Parents, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when they endeavour to hinder us from doing what is good; for in ſuch caſes he commands us to hate them. May our Lord give your Highneſs
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:57883:110"/>good and true Counſel in all things, and Grace al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways do his Will, and hereafter to enjoy his Holy Glory.</hi> Amen.</p>

               <p>The Biſhop growing weary of diſputing, betook himſelf to his Pen again; and having Compoſed a Treatiſe againſt all the <hi>Habaſſin</hi> Errors, he Preſented it to the Emperor, conjuring him to read it without Prejudice.

               <p>The Biſhop finding his Writings were as Unſucceſsful as his Conferences and Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, left the Court in Wrath, retiring to a place called <hi>Decome,</hi> where he had not been long before he thundred out the following Excommunication.</p>

               <p>This was publiſhed in our Church of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come</hi> on the 2d. of <hi>February</hi> 1559. Whatever eaſe the publication of this Cenſure might give the Coadjutor's mind, which was ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exulcerated by the Triumphs of the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſins,</hi> it is certain it had no more effect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Emperor, than his Conferences and Books had had; <hi>Who the more he knew of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and its ways, the worſe he liked it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But while <hi>Claudius</hi> his thoughts were wholly employed in Diſputing with, and Writing againſt the Biſhop, and Fathers, <hi>Nur</hi> the Son of <hi>Madi Ali Guaſil,</hi> and the King of <hi>Adel,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving obſerved the preſent weakneſs of the <hi>Habaſſin</hi> Empire, and how its Frontiers lay open, Invaded it with a great Army; and meeting with little or no oppoſition, were got into the bowels of it before <hi>Claudius</hi> ever ſo much as dream'd of an Invaſion; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs when the alarm of it came from all quarters, <hi>Claudius</hi> laying aſide his Pen and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:57883:113"/>Books, called for his Sword, and having ſweeped together a confuſed rabble of an Army, he took the Field, and being come within ſight of the Enemy, was ſo ill adviſed as to give him Battel; in which <hi>Claudius</hi> was not ſo ſucceſsful, as he was ſaid to have been in his <hi>ergoteering</hi> Combats, his Army being totally Routed, and he himſelf Slain fighting Manfully againſt the <hi>Infidels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> though angry with <hi>Claudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> do him the Juſtice to acknowledge that he was a <hi>Prince of admirable natural Parts,</hi> and for an <hi>Habaſſin, of very good Learning;</hi> and as he was every way <hi>much a Gentleman,</hi> that he would alſo have been extraordinary kind to the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> that remained in <hi>Ethiopia</hi> for the great Service they had done, had it not been for two things; the one was, that they would never let him alone with his Religion, which he was extreamly Zealous for; and the other was, that under a pretence of intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith into <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> they had a deſign either to make themſelves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of its Sea-ports, or to have put them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of a Creature of their own, as they had done in ſeveral parts of <hi>India,</hi> after they had by ſome plauſible pretence or other got footing in them; and as the cloſe Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence they maintained with <hi>Bahurnagays,</hi> the Hereditary Governor of the Provinces on the Sea-Coaſt, was ſufficient to give <hi>Claudius</hi> ſome umbrage of this deſign, ſo if he ever happened to intercept any of the Biſhop's or Father's Letters, he muſt have been abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſatisfied of the truth of it; the ſending
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:57883:113"/>of Miſſionary Troops into <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> without which the Eccleſiaſtical Miſſionaries would be able to do nothing there, being, as we ſhall ſee hereafter, the burden of all their Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So feeble a thing is Popery to make way for it ſelf into any Countrey, without the aſſiſtance of Apoſtolical Dragoons.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Nur,</hi> after having ravaged and plundered the greateſt and richeſt Provinces in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> returned home laden with Spoils and Honour; but when he came near his Metropolis, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of making a Triumphant entry, as was expected, he mounted a ſorry Mule wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly Equipp'd, and rid thereon thorough all the Acclamations of his People; and being asked the reaſon why he did ſo, his anſwer was, <hi>That ſince it was God alone that won the late Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it was but juſt that he alone ſhould have the whole Glory of it.</hi>

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:57883:114"/>Empire a vaſt treaſure both of Money and Blood:</hi> And in order to the extirpating ſo pernicious an Inmate, as he reckoned it to be, he firſt took <hi>all the Lands which had been given by his Brother to the</hi> Portugueſes <hi>for their Service, from them;</hi> and afterwards their <hi>Children, committing them to the care of ſuch as would be ſure to Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate them in the</hi> Alexandrian <hi>Faith.</hi> After this, he Commanded the Coadjutor <hi>to be apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and thrown into Priſon, threatning to Burn him and his Jeſuits alive, if they did not give over corrupting his People with their falſe Doctrines:</hi> And having one day ordered the Coadjutor to be brought before him,
<note place="margin">A Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Emperor and Coad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jutor.</note> he fell upon him after a moſt barbarous manner, asking him, <hi>Whether it was not ſufficient that he ſuffered him to live in his Empire to look after his</hi> Portugueſes, <hi>but he muſt be corrupting his Monks and Subjects with his He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies?</hi> adding, <hi>let me adviſe you, as you love your Life, not to tamper any more with my Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</hi> The Coadjutor made anſwer, <hi>That he did nothing but what his Office obliged him to, and that he would do, whatever it coſt him.</hi> This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Anſwer put <hi>Adam</hi> into ſuch a fury, that after having called the <hi>Coadjutor a great many hard Names,</hi> and asked him, <hi>How he durſt come into</hi> Ethiopia <hi>to Preach his Lies and Fopperies in it?</hi> He flew upon him, and tore his Robes, the Courtiers having much ado to take him off; and having ſent for him ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, he told him after a great deal of <hi>foul Language, That if he would not promiſe to give over Corrupting his Subjects, his head ſhould pay for it.</hi> The Coadjutor without anſwering a word, <hi>Croſſed his Arms, and hung down his

               </p>
               <p>But the chief cauſe of <hi>Adam</hi> treating the Coadjutor and <hi>Portugueſes</hi> thus, diſcovered it ſelf in a ſudden Rebellion that brake out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him at this time,

But Father <hi>Andrew</hi> being
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:57883:115"/>diſcovered at <hi>Arkiko,</hi> as he was ready to have embarked on a Ship belonging to the <hi>Baneans,</hi> was hewed in pieces by the <hi>Mahometans.</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Teller</hi> after having pronounced Father <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew</hi> a <hi>Martyr,</hi> juſtifies the cauſe of his death, by affirming, <hi>Que eſta ſempre à pratica doſque tem experientia de</hi> Ethiopia, <hi>que ſem as armas na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam que, defendam &amp; Authorizem à os pregado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res Catholicos, nam poderam nunqua ter ò Succeſſo deſeiado entre aquelles Schiſmaticos;</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>It had always been the opinion of ſuch as had any experience in the Affairs of</hi> Ethiopia, <hi>that unleſs the Catholick Preachers were defended and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized by Dragoons, they would never have the ſucceſs that was deſired among thoſe Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> being ſenſible of this, and dreading nothing ſo much as the coming of <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Troops into his Empire, notwithſtanding the groſs of the Rebellion was in an Inland Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, where they had Proclaimed one <hi>Taſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> a Son of <hi>Adam</hi>'s elder Brother, Emperor; He marched firſt againſt <hi>Bahurnagays,</hi> reſolving if it were poſſible, to break his Army before it received a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Reinforcement. <hi>Adam</hi> had two Battels with <hi>Bahurnagays:</hi> In the firſt he is ſaid to have been worſted by him; but to have routed <hi>Bahurnagays</hi> to that degree in the laſt, that he was forc'd to ſculk about the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coaſt with a handful of <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> all of that Nation that were at liberty in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> having run into him when he firſt took up Arms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> having thus quelled <hi>Bahurnagays,</hi> and being inform'd, that now the Moſons were
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:57883:115"/>over,
<note place="margin">He is rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and goes over to the <hi>Turks.</hi>
                  </note> there was no fear of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> being trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with any <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Troops for one ſix Months at ieaſt. He marched back to find out his Nephew, who had been Proclaimed Emperor, and being come up with him, he obliged him to come to a Battel; the Fight continued obſtinate for ſome hours, but in the concluſion the Rebels were overthrown, and <hi>Taſcaro</hi> being taken Priſoner, had his head chopped off immediately by his Uncle's order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> after theſe Victories thought to have taken ſome reſt; when intelligence was brought him, that <hi>Bahurnagays</hi> deſpairing of finding mercy at his hands, and of the coming of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> which had been promiſed him, had with the handful of <hi>Portugueſes</hi> that ſtuck to him, taken Sanctuary among the <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> and was incouraging them to invade <hi>Ethiopia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The honeſt Author of the <hi>Aſia Portugueſe,</hi> ſaith, This trick of the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> going over with <hi>Bahurnagays</hi> to the <hi>Turks,</hi> was ſo ill taken by the <hi>Habaſſin</hi> Emperors, that they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after that endure to hear of having any Soldiers of that Nation in their Countrey; but as we ſhall ſee hereafter, that did not hinder the Miſſionaries, who deſired to ſee ſuch Troops in <hi>Ethiopia</hi> above all things in the world,
<note place="margin">He brings the <hi>Turks</hi> into <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia,</hi> and delivers <hi>Matrua,</hi> and the other Sea-Port Towns to them.</note> from making bold to ſend for them in their Names.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Mahometans</hi> having at <hi>Nagay</hi>'s inſtigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Marched into <hi>Ethiopia</hi> with a great Army, had <hi>Arkiko</hi> and <hi>Matzua</hi> the only Sea-Ports of that Empire delivered to them by <hi>Nagay</hi>'s crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; which places as they were of more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to them than the whole Countrey
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:57883:116"/>beſides, by making them Maſters of the whole Coaſt of the <hi>Red-Sea;</hi> ſo having once got them into their hands, they have taken care to keep them, continuing Maſters of them to this day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> not being able to brook this loſs, and the great devaſtations that were made by the Infidels in the beſt Provinces of his Empire, reſolved to venture it all, or to recover what he had loſt; and ſo tho he was ſenſible of his Armies being in all reſpects inferior to that of the Enemy; yet being puſhed on by his rage, he determined to bid them Battel;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Adam</hi> is ſlain in Battel.</note> which the Infidels having accepted of, did maul the <hi>Habaſſins</hi> ſo with their Artillery, that they preſently gave ground, <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf being overthrown upon heaps of his ſlain Men, moſt of the reſt that fled being either made Priſoners, or put to the Sword. The whole <hi>Habaſſin</hi> Baggage having upon this total rout fallen into the hands of the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> among it the Coadjutor and his <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> whom <hi>Adam</hi> had carried along with him as Hoſtages in all his Marches,
<note place="margin">The Coad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jutor and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are made Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners by the <hi>Turks.</hi>
                  </note> were found, and were all ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with the ſlain, before <hi>Bahurnagays</hi> and his <hi>Portugueſe</hi> could come to their Relief.</p>
               <p>So that notwithſtanding the Biſhop and his Fathers had their full revenge of <hi>Adam</hi> for having treated them ſo barbarouſly; yet I do not find that they much bettered their condition by it. One of the Fathers in a Letter that was writ after <hi>Adam</hi> was ſlain, telling his Brethren at <hi>Goa,</hi> that at the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thereof, they were in as lamentable
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:57883:116"/>an eſtate as it is almoſt poſſible for men to be, in having neither Clothes, Bread, nor Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit; and that the poor Coadjutor was in ſuch a Garb, that it was enough to make a Chriſtian's heart bleed to ſee him in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> being ſlain, was ſucceeded by his Son <hi>Malac Saged,</hi> who was Crowned and Anointed at <hi>Axun,</hi> and who tho he Reigned Thirty Years, was never one day out of War either with his Neighbours or Subjects, and as to the main was Victorious ſtill;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Adam</hi> is ſucceeded by his Son <hi>Malac Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,</hi> who takes no notice of the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionaries.</note> and tho he hated the <hi>Roman</hi> Church no leſs than his Father; nevertheleſs having his thoughts wholly taken up with War, he gave the Coadjutor and the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> after they returned to <hi>Fremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> no manner of Moleſtation, unleſs they were troubled at his taking no more notice of them than if there had been no ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in his Countrey: Neither did the Coad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jutors declaring himſelf Patriarch, upon his having received advice of the Patriarch <hi>Baret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>'s death, who died at <hi>Goa</hi> on the Twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of <hi>December,</hi> 1562, ingage the Emperor to have ere the more regard for him; and as the Emperor gave the Patriarch no trouble in his retirement, ſo neither did the Patriarch give him any,
<note place="margin">The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch dying at <hi>Goa,</hi> the Coadjutor becomes Patriarch.</note> who deſpairing of being able to do any good in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> without the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi>-Troops, made the ſolliciting of them his whole buſineſs. So in a Letter to the General of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> bearing date the 3d of <hi>June,</hi> 1566. he tells him, <hi>There was one thing he and the Fathers were all agreed in, which was, That nothing but a good body of</hi> Portugueſe <hi>Soldiers would ever be able to reduce</hi> Ethiopia <hi>to
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:57883:117"/>the Obedience of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church;</hi> and in one of the ſame date to the Rector of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> College at <hi>Goa,</hi> he tells him, <hi>There was one thing he might be certain of,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch ſollicits hard for Troops.</note> 
                  <hi>which was, that there was no other remedy for</hi> Ethiopia, <hi>but a good body of</hi> Portugueſe <hi>Troops,</hi> adding, <hi>that if they had but</hi> 5 <hi>or</hi> 600 <hi>ſtout Musketeers, he would undertake for the reducing of</hi> Ethiopia <hi>to the</hi> Roman <hi>Church in a ſhort time:</hi> Concluding his Letter with a complaint, <hi>that more men were daily expoſed to greater dangers for things of much leſs Importance, even to the State,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Father <hi>Fermandes</hi> do's the ſame.</note> 
                  <hi>and where the ſucceſs was infinitely more doubtful.</hi> And <hi>Manuel Fernandes</hi> in a Letter to the Provincial and <hi>Jeſuits</hi> of <hi>Goa,</hi> chimes exactly with his Patriarch, in this note. <hi>What ſhall I ſay, ſaith</hi> Fernandes, <hi>my deareſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Brethren! to blame your Reverences who are in</hi> India <hi>for the great neglect of not having ſent the Troops whereon the Reduction of this Empire depends intirely, I know would be unjuſt; being certain, that if it had been in your Reverence's power to have appli'd it, that we had had that remedy long before this time: Nevertheleſs there is one thing I muſt beg of you, and that is, That ſince your Reverences do heartily wiſh that we had thoſe Soldiers, tho it is not in your yower to ſend them to us, that you would pray ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to Chriſt to put it into their hearts, in whoſe power it is to do it effectually. I am likewiſe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that if your Reverences did but ſee what is loſt here in</hi> Ethiopia <hi>for want of a handful of men, who would alſo be able to protect thoſe who have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready embraced our Faith, that you would run how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and lamenting ſo great a loſs thorough all the ſtreets of the City: Your Reverences may think of this what you pleaſe, but I do ſay and affirm, That
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:57883:117"/>the Order of</hi> Jeſuits <hi>has no where ſo noble and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous an enterprize upon their hands as this of</hi> Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia, <hi>if they could but finiſh it: Neither ought it to ſeem ſtrange to you, that we ſhould ſay, That a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Soldiers is neceſſary to the reduction of this Church, conſidering that there is nothing more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, than that at the ſame time you loſe the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the King, the work of converſion goes on but very dull; and no wonder, ſince even in</hi> Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, <hi>the Prelates, if they had not the aſſiſtance of the Secular Arm, would not be able to do their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and though it is true that we pretend to have no other buſineſs here but the ſervice of God, and the promotion of the good of peoples Souls; yet it is certain, that thoſe Troops, if they were once here, would quickly clear this Empire of all its Foreign and Domeſtick Enemies, chiefly of the</hi> Turks <hi>and</hi> Galls, <hi>by whom it is at this time ſo miſerably haraſſed, and againſt whom the unhappy Natives are not able to make head; who as they contradict our Lord, ſo our Lord contradicts them in chaſtiſing them with flies, for the</hi> Galls <hi>are no better: It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an unconceivable thing, how ſuch a ſorry naked People ſhould be able to do the things that they do againſt the</hi> Habaſſins, <hi>who have both Arms and Horſes, were it not that God makes, and will make Wur againſt them, until ſuch time as they ſhall give over making War againſt his Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty: Wherefore ſince a good body of Soldiers would remedy all our wants, Spiritual and Temporal, let me again beg it of your Reverences, to beſeech God to ſend us this neceſſary Succour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I would have your Reverences likewiſe remember, with how great Zeal and Charity our holy Father</hi> Ignatius <hi>commanded our Superiors in</hi> Portugal,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:57883:118"/>
                  <hi>nos to fail to ſpeak to the King, who is now with God, once a Month, at leaſt, concerning the</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſin <hi>Miſſion: But though my intent in putting you in mind of this, ſhould not be to engage you to do the ſame with the Viceroy; yet this I will affirm, That ſince this is the Cauſe of God, and the Society, and ſo great a Cauſe too, that you ought never to give over ſoliciting both God and Princes about this affair: So that it may never be ſaid of us,</hi> They begun to build, but could not finiſh. <hi>Finally, I do aſſure you, That if we had but thoſe Troops once, that not only</hi> Ethiopia, <hi>but another</hi> Europe <hi>would be brought quickly to the Knowledge of Chriſt, and the Obedience of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Jeſuits of <hi>Goa, Lisbon,</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> were ſo inflamed by theſe paſſionate Letters, that the Cardinal <hi>Don Henry,</hi> who during the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority of his Nephew <hi>Don Sebaſtian,</hi> govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Portugal,</hi> could not be quiet day nor night for them, his not ordering ſo ſmall a body of Men to be ſent where they would infallibly do both the Church and Crown ſo great ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, being every where roared at by them, as both the moſt ungodly and impolitick thing that any Government had ever been guilty of.</p>

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:57883:120"/>
                        <hi>whoſe Faith never did nor never will fail, and who is the Mother and Miſtreſs of all the Churches in the world, and of all faithful Chriſtians, being continued in your Pontificate.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>As to your having commanded me to go to the Iſland of</hi> Japan <hi>by the firſt convenience, I have had no opportunity ſince I received your Commands, and ſo am excuſed for not being gone; neither in truth can I embark here with any ſafety, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thouſand</hi> Turkiſh <hi>Ships, and not one Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian in the Port of</hi> Matzua <hi>at this time. As to what is ſaid of having any hopes of the reducing of</hi> Ethiopia, <hi>I ſhould quickly have ſuch hopes, could we but have Five or Six hundred</hi> Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſes <hi>ſent hither from the</hi> Indies, <hi>according to what was agreed before I left</hi> Goa, <hi>upon the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice they had received there, of the obſtinacy of the King of</hi> Ethiopia, <hi>and which we have been now long expecting. Were this once done, I ſhould not only hope to ſee</hi> Ethiopia <hi>quickly reduced, but ſhould be infallibly certain of it: With which Troops we ſhould not only be able to convert all this Empire, but innumerable multitudes of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens alſo, into whoſe Countries they might march from hence, without croſſing any Sea: Which Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens being a ſimple ſort of people, and not much addicted to Idolatry, might be converted with great eaſe. We have been told that great numbers of them have petitioned the King of</hi> Ethiopia <hi>to be made Chriſtians, but have been denied out of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral reſpects, the</hi> Ethiopians <hi>reckoning that after they are Chriſtians it is not lawful to make them Slaves, as they do now in vaſt numbers. The Heathens that deſired this, were of</hi> Damut, <hi>a Countrey that abounds with</hi> Pure Gold, <hi>and is ſaid
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:57883:121"/>to reach to the King of</hi> Portugal<hi>'s Territories which are about</hi> Moſambique <hi>and</hi> Sefalia. <hi>There are Heathens likewiſe in another Countrey called</hi> Sinaxi, <hi>which is alſo full of</hi> Fine Gold, <hi>and who about three years ago offered to a Prince who is nearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the King of</hi> Ethiopia, <hi>if he would but deſiſt from the War he had begun upon them, both to turn Chriſtians, and to pay him a Yearly Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute. It is from among theſe Heathens, but chiefly thoſe of</hi> Dambut, <hi>that the</hi> Mahometan <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, who are in great numbers in theſe parts, do daily buy vaſt numbers of Slaves, which they ſell to the</hi> Moors <hi>and</hi> Turks: <hi>Theſe Heathens would turn Chriſtians with all their hearts, for they cry and take on lamentably when they are carried to the Ships; to which they are driven in ſuch herds, that I am perſuaded that the</hi> Turks <hi>have had at leaſt an Hundred thouſand of them, who make them all</hi> Mahometans, <hi>and who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards are known by experience to become ſtout Soldiers, and to do the</hi> Saracens <hi>great Service both by Sea and Land. All which miſchiefs Five or Six hundred</hi> Portugueſe <hi>Soldiers, if we had them here, would remedy, and would do extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſervice to the state of</hi> India, <hi>and to all the Chriſtians thereof; for if the</hi> Turks <hi>ſhould once make themſelves Maſters of</hi> Ethiopia, <hi>it would be of fatal conſequence to the</hi> Portugueſe <hi>Intereſt in the</hi> Indies; <hi>there being divers things in this Countrey, that would be ſerviceable to them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to their Galleys, as Slaves, Iron, and other Proviſions.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>The King that firſt began to perſecute our Holy Faith, and all his Miniſters, are now in their Graves; and his Son, who now reigns, is not Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:57883:121"/>the Royal Authority having been much ſhaken and impaired of late, God in his Juſtice having ſo ordered things, that he that refuſed to obey him, and ſubmit himſelf to the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, from which all that have ſeparated themſelves obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have been deſtroyed, and have fallen under the yoke of Infidels, ſhould not be obeyed by his own Subjects. The people here are all in pieces, and are ſo cowed by the devaſtations the</hi> Turks <hi>have made among them, that they think of nothing, but how to live and keep their Eſtates. But tho the late King and his Miniſters were poſſeſſed with a ſtrange Rage againſt the Catholick Faith, and us Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, the common people and ſome others ſeemed to be well enough diſpoſed towards it. For our part we have not been ſparing of our pains to preach to them; and beſides divers Conferences and Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions both private and publick that we have had with them, we have written divers Treatiſes againſt their Errors, and have got them tranſlated into</hi> Habaſſin; <hi>ſo that all the Doctrines of Faith have been ſufficiently promulgated to them, if they could but be perſuaded to embrace them; not but that there are great numbers of them who are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied of the truth of our Faith, but who either out of ſhame, or fear of puniſhment, are afraid to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it: For which reaſon there are ſeveral that would be glad to ſee ſome</hi> Portugueſe <hi>Troops here to defend them in the Faith after they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed it; out of which, by reaſon of their being but weak therein, they are now eaſily terrified, as a great many have been; tho there are ſome who notwithſtanding all the contradiction they have met withal, do continue ſtedfaſt therein.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>It is a common Tradition here, That the</hi> Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſes <hi>are to come among them to make them of the ſame Faith with themſelves; and they ſay further, and we believe it to be true, That this diſtracted Empire will never be in peace or any to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable order, until they come; which though they ſhould, and with an intention of offering Violence, would</hi> give no offence to any body; not to Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks to be ſure, there being no reaſon why they ſhould be offended at it; <hi>no nor the</hi> Habaſſins <hi>neither, for I am perſuaded that if ſuch a number of</hi> Portugueſe <hi>Troops were here, their name with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtriking a ſtroke would do the work, ſo that they would look more like Friends than Enemies; and I am certain, that if they had come when we expected them, this whole Empire had been in the Obedience of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church before this time, and it will be the ſame thing if they ſhould come now.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Wherefore, moſt holy Father, ſince all theſe things do belong to your Office, who are the Univerſal Paſtor, feed theſe your ſheep with wholſome food, and provide a neceſſary remedy for them, by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the moſt Serene King of</hi> Portugal <hi>for ſome Troops, and by acquainting his Ambaſſador at your Court, with the neceſſity there is of ſending them hither; for to tell your Holineſs my mind frankly, I am of opinion, That</hi> Ethiopia <hi>ought not to be deſerted.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But after all, if there is no perſuading the King of</hi> Portugal <hi>to ſend a body of Soldiers hither, for which for the good of</hi> Ethiopia, <hi>let me beg it of your Holineſs a ſecond time to write to him, he muſt then be deſired to ſend a good Fleet hither to carry off the Catholicks; for ſhould it be
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:57883:122"/>ſuch a one as is talked of, it would not be able to carry one of them to the</hi> Indies, <hi>the</hi> Turks <hi>being very ſtrong at preſent in</hi> Matzua <hi>and all theſe Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports; and whatever is done, let us not loſe any of the Catholicks that are here, by leaving them in the hands of</hi> Hereticks <hi>and</hi> Infidels; <hi>who after the Heads of their Families and Prieſts, who are mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal as well as other men, are dead, will be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being loſt.</hi>

               <p>This Letter of the Patriarch's gives the Reader a clear view of the true temper of the <hi>Roman</hi> Miſſionaries, and of the methods they are for making uſe of in the Converſion of <hi>Heretical</hi> Kingdoms to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; it diſcloſeth likewiſe the true ſecret of <hi>Bahurnagays</hi>'s Rebellion,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:57883:123"/>which was of ſuch fatal conſequence to <hi>Ethiopia;</hi> it being ſaid in this Letter, That the Coadjutor before he left <hi>Goa,</hi> had a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that a good Body of <hi>Portugueſes</hi> ſhould be ſent after him; as it is alſo, that if theſe Troops had arrived when they were expected, which was when <hi>Bahurnagays</hi> was firſt in Arms, the <hi>Habaſſin</hi> Church had been reduced to the Obedience of the <hi>Roman</hi> before the writing of that Letter.</p>
               <p>Now what ſhould it be that hindered the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Government, which ſtill pretended that the propagating of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Faith, was its chief aim in all its remote Conqueſts, and whoſe title to them all, was founded ſolely on that pretence, from ſending ſuch a handful of Men, to do the Church ſo ſignal a ſervice as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting of another <hi>Europe</hi> to it?</p>
               <p>It was not that they were fearful that the Number of Soldiers that was deſired,

               <p>The true cauſe therefore of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying ſo inconſiderable an aid to do ſo great a work, though ſo vehemently ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to do it, was, that though at firſt they had promiſed themſelves great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from the reduction of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> to the Obedience of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, they found afterwards that the doing of it would be of little or no advantage to them, by reaſon of its lying quite out of the way of their great <hi>Indian</hi> Trade, and its having no native Commodities to countervail the great Charge, its remote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the neighbourhood of the <hi>Turks,</hi> would neceſſarily put them too, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an intereſt in it.</p>
               <p>Neither were the Patriarch and Fathers ſuch weak Men as not to know at what their buſineſs ſtuck, who therefore took care in all their Letters to aſſure the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that beſides divers other Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, there was <hi>abundance of Fine Gold</hi> in ſome parts of <hi>Ethiopia;</hi> and that <hi>Damut,</hi> which might eaſily be Converted by 600 Soldiers, and <hi>which was likewiſe full of Gold,</hi> did reach to <hi>Moſambique</hi> and <hi>Sefala,</hi> the beſt <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Plantation in the <hi>Indies;</hi> but the Government, it ſeems, either did <hi>not believe theſe reports,</hi> or thought they <hi>ſhould Buy fine Gold there too dear to turn to any account.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſter had this among other Inſtances undoubtedly in his eye, who told <hi>Philip</hi> the IVth. <hi>That it was a vain conceit the World had entertained of
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:57883:124"/>the Zeal of the</hi> Portugueſes <hi>upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Converſions which had been made by them in the</hi> Indies; <hi>for it was Covetouſneſs and not Zeal that had engaged them to make all thoſe Conqueſts; the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions that had been made in thoſe parts having been performed by the Divine Power, and the Charity of a few particular Friars, the Crown and Government having had no other aim therein, but the Robbing of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Cities; and there were ſtill the greateſt Converſions where there was moſt to gratifie their Covetouſneſs; but where there was nothing to be had, there the People were Obdurate and not to be wrought upon. And ſo we ſee their Zeal expired quickly where it was not animated by Covetouſneſs; and how they who had nothing elſe to ſay, but</hi> Lord open unto us, <hi>were not thought fit to enter into Heaven.</hi>

               <p>The Cardinal-Regent having prevailed with the Pope to recal the Patriarch, did order <hi>Ruy Laurenco de Tavara,</hi> who went Viceroy to the <hi>Indies</hi> in the year 1567. ſo ſoon as he arrived at <hi>Goa,</hi> to ſend ſome Ships to <hi>Ethiopia</hi> to fetch off the Patriarch and the Fathers; but <hi>Tavara</hi> happening to die in the Voyage, thoſe Orders, whatever was the reaſon, were never executed; though if they had, ſo ſoon as it was poſſible, the Ships would have come too late for the Patriarch, who died at <hi>Fremona</hi> on the 9th.

            <p>AT the time of the Patriarch's death, of the Five Jeſuits that went with him into <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> there were but Three left alive; they were <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel Fernandez,</hi> the <hi>moſt paſſionate Solicitor for Dragoons,</hi> who died at <hi>Fremona</hi> in the year 1583. <hi>Antony Fernandez,</hi> who died at the ſame place 10 years after, and <hi>Francis Lopez,</hi> who lived till the year 1597. after whoſe death there was not one <hi>Roman</hi> Prieſt left alive in <hi>Ethiopia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Nine years after the Patriarch's deceaſe, the Jeſuits ſeemed to have given the <hi>Habaſſin</hi> Miſſion quite over; none of that Order, that we read of, having, during that time, attempted to go thither: But upon <hi>Philip</hi> the IId's. (who pretended to a much greater Zeal than any of his Anceſtors for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church) coming to the Crown of <hi>Portugal,</hi> they reſumed the thoughts of it again; and not knowing but that all the Fathers who were in <hi>Ethiopia</hi> might be in the

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:57883:128"/>thereof, as he was Primate of the</hi> Indies, did take the <hi>Habaſſin</hi> Affair into his own hands, and having caſt about how to have Intelligence from thence, and to ſupply the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> that were there with a Prieſt, he did at laſt fall upon the following expedient.</p>
            <p>There was one <hi>Belchior de Sylva,</hi> a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted <hi>Bramen,</hi> who was Vicar of the Church of St. <hi>Ann</hi> in <hi>Goa;</hi> whom the Archbiſhop after he had determined to ſend him into <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> ordered upon ſome Informations he pretended to have received againſt him, to be thrown into Priſon, threatening him with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Cenſures if what he was accuſed of ſhould be proved; having at the ſame time ſo concerted the matter with <hi>Sylva,</hi> that he was to break Jayl on a certain night, and come to him in a diſguiſe at a place called <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dez,</hi> which he was then going to viſit, being in the mean time to let his Hair and Beard grow, the better to diſguiſe himſelf.

            <p>The Jeſuits, that nothing might ſeem to have been done towards the reduction of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> without their having had ſome hand in it, will have the Archbiſhop to have ſent <hi>Sylva</hi> thither at their requeſt: But this was not all that Archbiſhop <hi>Menezes</hi> did in this matter; for having received advice of <hi>Sylva</hi>'s being arrived in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> he thereupon writ a Letter, not only <hi>to the</hi> Roman <hi>Catholicks, but to the</hi> Abuna likewiſe,

            <p>The King had writ likewiſe to the Viceroy, <hi>To furniſh the Jeſuits with ſix Ships, to conveigh their Miſſionaries into</hi> Ethiopia; but they having but three Friars to ſend thither, who were Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Peter,</hi> who had been ranſomed a year or two before; and Father <hi>Anthony de Angelis,</hi> a <hi>Neopolitan,</hi> and Father <hi>Anthony Fernandes,</hi> a <hi>Portugueſe;</hi> the Viceroy reckoning <hi>that two Ships were ſufficient to carry three Friars, and that ſix would not be enough to fight the</hi> Turks, <hi>if they happened to meet with them,</hi> ſent but two to them to <hi>Dio,</hi> where they were now ſetled in their new College, one of which was forced back by a Storm to <hi>Damon,</hi> the other getting to <hi>Dio,</hi> but much damaged both in her Hulk and Rigging.</p>

            <p>Father <hi>Peter</hi> having, during his ſeven years Captivity in <hi>Arabia,</hi> made himſelf a perfect Maſter of the <hi>Arabick</hi> Tongue, did converſe much at <hi>Dio,</hi> where he paſſed <hi>for an Armenian Chriſtian</hi> with the <hi>Mahometans</hi> that came to trade there, but chiefly with a Servant of the Baſhaws of <hi>Suaqhem,</hi> whoſe name was <hi>Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Aga,</hi> with whom he contracted an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate familiarity. This <hi>Aga</hi> happening one day in diſcourſe to ask the Father, <hi>Why, after ſeven years captivity, he did not think of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home to his own Countrey, meaning</hi> Armenia; the Father told him, <hi>That there was nothing that he was ſo deſirous of as to ſee</hi> Armenia, <hi>but that he was afraid to venture himſelf again in the</hi> Turkiſh <hi>Territories: Aga</hi> thereupon did frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly undertake to put him in a way to get home with ſafety, offering to carry him along with him to <hi>Matzua</hi> and <hi>Suaqhem,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Cayr,</hi> from whence he promiſed to ſend him with a Paſs to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> from which place he might return home without any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. The Father having thanked <hi>Aga</hi> for his kind offer, told him <hi>he would accept of it, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he would give him leave, when he was at</hi> Matzua, <hi>to make a ſtep into</hi> Ethiopia, <hi>to negotiate a little buſineſs he had to do there;</hi> deſiring him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <hi>not to let the Governor of</hi> Dio <hi>know any thing of his deſign of returning home, for that he would certainly ſtop him, if he came to hear of it. Aga,</hi> who did not know but that he might have occaſion to return to <hi>Dio</hi> again, and for that reaſon, being unwilling to do any thing whereby he might diſoblige the Governour, told the Father, <hi>That though he ſhould be very
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:57883:131"/>glad to ſerve him in taking him along with him, yet unleſs he could obtain leave of the Governour to go, he muſt pardon him for not doing it:</hi> The Father being well pleaſed with <hi>this ſcruple</hi> of <hi>Aga</hi>'s, did promiſe ſince <hi>he would not carry him without it, to try to obtain leave of the Governour to go with him.

Father <hi>Peter,</hi> notwithſtanding his ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil treatment, was in pain till he was got from <hi>Matzua,</hi> and having notice of ſix Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians that were bound for <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> he took the opportunity of their company, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fixed his Journey on the 5th of <hi>May,</hi> he went to take his leave of his Patron <hi>Aga,</hi> who promiſed to <hi>wait two months for him at</hi> Matzua, by which time the <hi>Armenian</hi> aſſured him <hi>he would be with him again.</hi>

               <hi>Jacob</hi> was but an Infant when his Father died; which was perhaps the chief reaſon why the Empreſs and Grandees of the Court <hi>were ſo zealous for his nomination, hoping during his long Minority, to have the Government wholly in their own hands.</hi> And ſo the firſt thing they did after the old Emperor's breath was out of his body, was to ſecure <hi>Za Danguil,</hi> that he might give them no moleſtation; which they reckoned they had done ſufficiently, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him a cloſe Priſoner in the Iſland of <hi>Deck,</hi> in the Lake of <hi>Dembea.</hi>

               <hi>THE Letter of the Emperor</hi> Aſnaf Sagued <hi>cometh to the Honourable Father and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the</hi> Portugueſes: <hi>How do you? Hear the good things God hath done for us: We were ſeven years a Priſoner, and did ſuffer innumerable Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; but God taking compaſſion of our Miſery, has delivered us out of Priſon, and made us the Head of All; according to that of</hi> David, The Stone which the Builders rejected, is made the Head of the Corner. <hi>May the ſame God that hath begun this Work, bring it to a good Iſſue: Hear more; We are very deſirous to ſee you here,</hi> and would have you bring the Books of the Laws of the King of <hi>Portugal, if you have them, along with you, for we ſhould be glad to ſee them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the Father was preparing, upon the receipt of this Letter, to have gone to the Court with the Viceroy of <hi>Tigre,</hi> he was ſtopped by the News of the <hi>Gauls</hi> having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded <hi>Ethiopia</hi> with Three Armies at once; having been encouraged to do it by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettled Poſture they expected to find the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of that Empire in, after ſo ſudden a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution.

                  <p>
                     <hi>IF a Friar of any other Order, do either out of a Zeal of Charity, or being called by the Faithful, come into theſe Parts, to give Spiritual Conſolation, or to adminiſter the Sacraments of the Church, after he has heard the Confeſſions of great numbers of perſons, who have not ſeen a Prieſt in Twenty years, to Confeſs themſelves to, and Confirmed ſuch as were wavering in the Faith, and reſtored ſuch as had Apoſtatiſed from it; the Provincial of the Jeſuits ſhall no ſooner hear thereof, let the Province be at never ſo great a diſtance from him, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he had never ſet his foot in it before, than he ſhall immediately fly thither to oppreſs ſo good a Miniſter: To whom he will repreſent, That that Countrey being a Pariſh under his Juriſdiction, he ought not to have adminiſtred the Sacraments therein; and upon pretence of the Peoples being his Sheep, will hinder him from performing any more Religious Offices to them. And if the Prieſt ſhould happen to have the courage to ask him, Why, if thoſe People are under his care, he had aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned them for ſo long a time? And whether he thought that one who had ſo deſerted his Flock, ought any longer to be eſteemed its Paſtor? The Jeſuit will anſwer him with, What Authority have you to ask me any ſuch queſtion? Or to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with things that do not belong to you? And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving affirmed that he has a right to what he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to, he will produce the Council of</hi> Trent, <hi>and read the Conſtitution to him,</hi> Which prohibits Prieſts upon pain of Excommunication to
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:57883:134"/>adminiſter the Sacraments in any Pariſh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Curate's leave: <hi>Neither will he content himſelf with that, but will render that Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into</hi> Japan, <hi>and publiſh it to all the People. And in caſe the ſaid Father ſhould reply, That the words of the Council have no relation to the Countries of</hi> Infidels, <hi>or to places which are newly Converted, or to</hi> Chriſtians <hi>who are Novices in the Faith, but are to be underſtood only of Countries which have been under</hi> Chriſtian <hi>Princes for divers Ages, and of ancient Pariſhes where People have been long Chriſtians; The Jeſuit ſhall, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, treat him publickly as a Tranſgreſſor of the Council, and do all that is in his power to drive him away, forbidding the People to take any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of him, or to have any communication with him; and if after that, any Chriſtian ſhould, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of Compaſſion or Devotion, receive him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Houſe, or ſhould enter himſelf into the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood of the</hi> Roſary, <hi>or of the</hi> Cord of St. Francis, <hi>he ſhall be reprimanded for it as boiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, and be treated by the Jeſuit with as much contempt, as if he had intirely renounced the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And as to the places where the Jeſuits are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily reſident, the Faithful dare not ſo much as offer to entertain a Friar that is not of their Order, nor have the leaſt communication with ſuch a one, unleſs it be privately; and if the Jeſuits come to hear of it, they will Chaſtiſe them ſeverely for it; which point they carry ſo far, as not to ſuffer any to be of their Congregations that are of a Fraternity of any other Order.</hi> A few lines after <hi>Sotelo</hi> adds: <hi>If Friars who are not of their Society do at any time addreſs themſelves to the Governor, or
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:57883:135"/>Vicar-General, to demand judicial Informations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Martyrdom of any of their Brethren, who have loſt their lives for the Catholick Faith, he will not ſo much as give them the hearing; whereas in the caſe of any of their own Brethren, or of any that have been Baptized by them, extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant relations are preſently exhibited, on purpoſe to ſet all the world a talking of them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If any thing that is great and illuſtrious is done by any other Friars, the Jeſuits do all that they can either totally to ſtifle it, or by artifices to eclipſe the glory and merit thereof; oppoſing all the underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings of all other Friars, and repreſenting them as things of little or no benefit; either accuſing what they write of falſhood, or attributing it to envy, or ſome other evil paſſion. And when they themſelves have at any time been the cauſe of any diſaſters, let it be never ſo notorious, they will throw the blame thereof off their own Society, and attribute it to the indiſcretion, imprudence, or bad conduct of ſome other Friars.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Neither can they endure that any thing ſhould be begun by People that are not of their Society; and let it be never ſo viſible, that their Order is not able alone to ſupport the burthen of Converting a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, yet there is no bringing them to admit of others to help them to bear it.</hi> Finally he tells us, <hi>That at the ſame time when the Jeſuits did all they could to hinder all other Prieſts and Friars from look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into</hi> Japan, <hi>that there were but Thirty of their Order in it, which was a very ſmall number for an Iſland conſiſting of Sixty ſix King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and more than Two hundred Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>

<pb n="246" facs="tcp:57883:136"/>him, <hi>Are you not amazed to ſee in how ſhort a time the Holy Father hath taught theſe Children ſo many Godly things?</hi> adding, <hi>but theſe wretched Monks of ours are juſt good for nothing.</hi> The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whenever they made any halt, went pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to viſit the Viceroy, who received him always with great Ceremony, obliging his own Monks whenever the Father waited up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, to withdraw. The Monks complained aloud of this treatment of the Viceroy's, <hi>but they had their complaints,</hi> ſaith a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> and <hi>the Father his Honours;</hi> but without telling us what it was that made this Ambitious Viceroy court the Father at ſuch a high rate, unleſs we will believe that it was <hi>only for his having taught two Boys to ſay their Catechiſm well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Emperor's Camp, or Court, for they are the ſame in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> was at that time at a place called <hi>Oudegere,</hi> upon the ſhoar of the lake of <hi>Dembea,</hi> where the Father was no ſooner arrived, than the Viceroy procured him an audience; and had poſſeſſed the Emperor with ſuch a high conceit of his extraordinary Abilities, that when the Father, after having kiſſed his hand, offered to have retired, he commanded him to ſit down by him, asking him ſeveral Queſtions concerning the Pope, the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Affairs of <hi>Europe,</hi> and the <hi>Indies.</hi> To all which Queſtions, the Father returned ſuch anſwers as he knew would pleaſe the Emperor.</p>
            <p>The Viceroy upon the Emperor's doing the Father ſuch extraordinary Honours, asked a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Captain that ſtood by him, what he thought <hi>the Monks, who were ſo angry at the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:57883:136"/>he had ſhewed him on his Journey, would ſay now of the greater honours done him by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror himſelf?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Emperor, after they had diſcourſed a conſiderable ſpace of time together, made a ſign to the Father to withdraw, having firſt commanded his Officers to entertain him ſplendidly, and according to his deſerts; and having ſent for him betimes, the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he entered into a long and ſerious diſpute with him concerning the <hi>Habaſſin</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Faith; which being ended, the Two Boys, upon the Viceroy's having told the Emperor what an aſtoniſhing thing it was to hear them, were called in <hi>to ſay their Catechiſm,</hi> which they did ſo much to the ſatisfaction of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, that he asked the Father after they had done, <hi>Whether he had not the Queſtions and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers they had repeated to admiration, in Writing:</hi> The Father having imagin'd, that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror might be deſirous to ſee the Catechiſm, was provided with one, which he preſented to him immediately; and the Emperor having read it over before he ſtirred, extolled it to the Skies as the Maſter-Piece of <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Viceroy's Brother-in-Law, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion in the Government during <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority, <hi>Rays Athanates,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Father <hi>Peter</hi> is highly Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the King and the whole Court.</note> entered likewiſe <hi>into a cloſe Friendſhip</hi> with the Father, making <hi>his Court to him,</hi> by ſending every day almoſt for his Two Boys to come and ſay <hi>their Catechiſm before</hi> him, and extolling their Performance and their Maſter's dexterity beyond either the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror or the Viceroy: <hi>Now if Two Boys ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:57883:137"/>been taught to ſay their Catechiſm well, was the Foundation of the great favour the Father was in at Court; it is the only inſtance in Hiſtory per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps of the favour of a whole Court's having been obtained by ſo ſlight a buſineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Emperor having read the Catechiſm ſeveral times over, was ſo <hi>charmed</hi> with it, that nothing would ſatisfy him, but the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Celebrating the <hi>Roman</hi> Maſs in his hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; which he did, with all the Solemnity that a ſingle Prieſt in his circumſtances could do it; and after Maſs, gave him a Sermon of an hour long; but happening as he was draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a concluſion, to ſay <hi>that he had a great deal more to add, were it not that he was afraid of being tedious to his Majeſty;</hi> the Emperor ſent him a Meſſage <hi>to go on, for that he ſhould take great pleaſure in hearing more from him:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Father gave him <hi>half an hour more.</hi> The Emperor was ſo well ſatisfied both with <hi>the Maſs</hi> and the <hi>Sermon,</hi> that he ſent the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Dinner from his own Table; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving called him to him in the Evening, he enquired of him, concerning the ſignification of every particular Ceremony and Veſtment that he had made uſe of in the Maſs, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be extreamly well pleaſed with all the Father's Anſwers: A little time after the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Dowager, <hi>Mariam Zima,</hi> coming to Court, deſired to hear the Father ſay Maſs and Preach; and having heard him, commended both the Maſs and Sermon extreamly, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, <hi>That ſhe could be content to live in a deſert all her days with ſo Godly a man as Father</hi> Peter: So that the Father had now <hi>got all the Three
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:57883:137"/>late Governors at his Devotion;</hi> who, as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable from the ſequel of the Story, <hi>had a great mind to be governing again, which they knew a few</hi> Portugueſe <hi>Troops would help them to with eaſe at any time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the Emperor, he was either not ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of <hi>this Plot,</hi> or elſe he endeavoured to <hi>countermine</hi> them, by <hi>careſſing</hi> the Father as much as they could do for their Lives: And ſo one day when the Father was to preach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, the <hi>Chair</hi> he uſed to ſit in when he preached, happening to be <hi>out of the way,</hi> the Emperor ordered <hi>his own Chair of State to be carried to him;</hi> and having ſeated himſelf on the Ground, ſaid, <hi>That it was not reaſonable for the Preacher and Maſter to ſtand, and the Hearer and Scholar to ſit;</hi> and after having thanked the Father for his good Diſcourſe, he told him, <hi>That now his name was high in</hi> Ethiopia, <hi>he would adviſe him as a friend, to be careful how be did any thing whereby he might forfeit the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion the world had of his Wiſdom and Holineſs; For, ſaid he, the fleſh is always fighting againſt us, and overcomes us many times before we are aware:</hi> for which good admonition the Father kiſſed his hand, and having returned him many thanks, promiſed him always to remember it.</p>
            <p>The Emperor having ſent for the Father one day, after having ſhut himſelf up with him, and his Favourite <hi>Habitucum Laca Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> in his Cloſet, required him to ſwear upon the Croſs not to divulge the ſecret he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to impart to him; which the Father ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done, he told him, <hi>That being now fully
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:57883:138"/>convinced that the Pope was the Head and Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Paſtor of the Church,
<note place="margin">The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers his intention to Father <hi>Peter</hi> to turn <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick.</note> he was reſolved to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himſelf to him, and to deſire him to ſend a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch with a competent number of Friars in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> Ethiopia <hi>to inſtruct his People in the true Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Father, who was overjoyed to hear theſe words from the Emperor, threw himſelf at his feet, wiſhing him a long life, that he might be able to accompliſh a deſign that would be ſo much to the benefit of his own Soul, and the Souls of his People. In purſuance of which Reſolution, the Emperor is ſaid to have prepared an Edict, prohibiting <hi>the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of</hi> Saturday, <hi>and of divers other</hi> Habaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin <hi>Rites, and to have been for running on ſo fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, to introduce Popery into his Empire,</hi> that Father <hi>Peter</hi> found himſelf obliged in policy to give a check to his Zeal, by telling him, <hi>That it would be ſafer and better to proceed more ſlowly, for fear of ruining his great deſign by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation.</hi> The Emperor asked him with heat, <hi>Why he was againſt his making haſte to introduce the true Faith into his Kingdom? What, did he think his Subjects would murther him for attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to do it?</hi> Adding, <hi>What if they ſhould, do you think I can loſe my life for a beiter Cauſe?</hi> The Father made anſwer, <hi>That though to loſe his life on ſuch an account, would be a great Mercy and Honour to his Majeſty; yet it would not be ſo, but an irreparable loſs to his Subjects in ſuch a Juncture.</hi> Here <hi>Luca Mariam</hi> interpoſed, and told the Emperor <hi>the Father loved him, and had given him good advice;</hi> but the Emperor inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting him, ſaid, <hi>Come, come, we muſt loſe no

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:57883:142"/>different deſigns, that it was not likely that they could hold long together; but the Emperor puſhed on by his own natural Courage, and provoked by the Inſolency of the Rebels, was deaf to this advice, and ſo did not only March directly towards them, but did offer them Battel ſo ſoon as he came up with them; and notwithſtanding Seventy of his beſt Troopers, who, I doubt, were <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> before a ſtroke was ſtruck, went over to the Enemy, that did not hinder the Emperor from engaging with them; the fight was bloody for ſome time, the Victory continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doubtful, till the Emperor, as he was fighting in Perſon more like a Heroe than a General, was Slain; upon whoſe fall,
<note place="margin">The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror is Killed Fighting.</note> his Men reckoning that they had then nothing to Fight for, threw down their Arms, and cri'd out for Quarter.

            </p>
            <p>There are ſaid to have been Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Profeſſion in the Two Armies; which if it was ſo, it ought to have obliged Father <hi>Peter</hi> to have gone with the Emperor, to have Confeſſed thoſe that were in his Army before they engaged, rather than to have ſtaid behind to do it to Two of that Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and whom he had then been Confeſſing for above Six Weeks.</p>
            <pb n="260" facs="tcp:57883:143"/>
            <p>But as we know little of what the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> did in <hi>Ethiopia, but from their own reports; ſo if any thing be brought to light in the managing of theſe Miſſions that does not make much for the honour of their Order, the diſcovery thereof muſt be owing purely to the irreſiſtible power of truth, which, though never ſo artificially diſguiſed, will ſtill give ſome glimpſes of it ſelf.</hi>

            <p>The Emperor, though not <hi>actually recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled</hi> to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> when he was ſlain, is ſaid for his <hi>good inclinations</hi> to it, to have had a <hi>Miracle wrought on his Body; it was not to bring him to life again;</hi> which the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror who took it out of the Earth to give it a more honourable Enterment, would have been very ſorry ſhould have been the effect of his Piety; but the <hi>Miracle was, That his Body when taken out of the Ground Ten years after it had been lodged in it, was found intire:</hi> A plain evidence, ſaith a Jeſuit, <hi>of the integrity of his Faith, Death not being ſtrong enough to exerciſe its tyranny on a body which had been ſo incorrupt in all matters of Juſtice.</hi>

            <p>As to Father <hi>Peter</hi>'s lamenting the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's Death ſo much as he does in a Letter, I do not take that to be any argument at all <hi>of his not having been privy to the Conſpiracy, but of the Conſpirators having either carried things far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than he would have had them, or perhaps than they themſelves at firſt intended, or of his having been too far engaged therein by his firſt Patron, the Viceroy of</hi> Tigre, <hi>before he ſaw the Court, to go back with honour or ſafety.</hi>

                  <hi>Jacob</hi>'s General goes over to <hi>Suſeneus.</hi>
               </note> but confirmed with the ſolemnity of an Oath, he withdrew himſelf privately from the Emperor's Camp, and having got into the Kingdom of <hi>Gojam,</hi> of which he had been made Viceroy a little before by <hi>Jacob,</hi> he there in a ſhort time got together a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able body of Men, with which he Marched and joyned <hi>Suſeneus,</hi> who received him with all poſſible demonſtrations of joy and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as one ſent from Heaven to help him to the Empire, which he had ſet his heart ſo much upon, that he did not care to outlive the hopes of attaining it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Suſeneus</hi> judging himſelf, with this Rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement, ſtrong enough to fight <hi>Jacob,</hi> Marched out of the Mountains to meet him, intending to decide their Quarrel by a pitch'd Battel; but when he came near <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Camp, finding him much ſtronger than he thought he had been, he changed his meaſures, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to act only upon the defence.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Jacob</hi> having now got his Enemy out of his Faſtneſſes, and knowing himſelf to be much ſuperior to him in number, for he is ſaid to have had Thirty to One, determined to fall upon him in his Camp, and having got between him and the Mountains, he
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:57883:148"/>commanded the Signal for a general Aſſault to be given; which being obſerved by <hi>Suſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus,</hi> he called all his Officers together, and told them, <hi>That ſince it was not now poſſible for them to avoid a Battel, they muſt either reſolve to make themſelves Lords and Princes by fighting manfully, or be content to be Slaves ſo long as they lived; That for his part he was reſolved either to Conquer, or not to ſurvive the Battel, deſiring them to Fight no longer than they ſaw him facing the Enemy: That if they would Sally out of their Trenches and fall upon the Enemy, which he took to be the beſt courſe, it being what the Enemy did not expect, he would lead them on in Perſon.</hi> The Officers and Soldiers being ſtrangely ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by this brisk Speech, gave a ſhout,

Suſeneus</hi> glad to ſee his men in ſuch a heat, did not give them time to cool, but marched, or rather ruſhed like a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent upon the Enemy, diſordering them ſo by the violence of the firſt ſhock he gave them, that they diſperſed immediately, ſo that it was much more like a Slaughter than a Fight, the Conqueror having loſt but Three Men in the Action; for <hi>where-ever</hi> Suſeneus <hi>appeared, the Enemy,</hi> according as his Hiſtorian <hi>Timo</hi> reports, <hi>fell before him as ſo many dry leaves off a fig-tree before the wind, or like a ſwarm of Locuſts when they fall into the Sea.</hi>

            <p>The Fathers, during all the time of this broyl, kept cloſe at <hi>Fremona,</hi> expecting to ſee to whom the Crown would fall at laſt; and having received certain advice of <hi>Seltem Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged</hi>'s great Succeſs, and of his being proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Emperor every where, they ſent two of their number to wait upon him, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate him upon his late Victory; Father <hi>Peter,</hi> who had been ſo very intimate with <hi>Jacob,</hi> not being looked upon as ſo fit a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for to carry this Complement.</p>

               </note> whoſe Names were <hi>Lawrence Romano,</hi> and <hi>Antony Fernandez,</hi> were graciouſly received by the Emperor, who to do them the greater Honour commanded his Purveyor to ſend their Supper to them; and was afterwards ſo mindful of them, as to ask him whether he had ſent them any Wine; and being told, that by reaſon of the Wines being diſtributed among the Nobles before he was
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:57883:149"/>ordered to ſend them any thing, he had not; the Emperor was very angry, asking him, How he durſt be guilty of ſuch an Error? commanding him to go preſently and carry his own portion of Wine to them, ſaying, <hi>I will drink Water rather than they ſhall.</hi> When the Fathers judged it proper, they went to wait upon the Emperor a ſecond time; who after ſome Complements, asked them, <hi>Where they reſided?</hi> And being told by them, <hi>That they had no certain Habitation in</hi> Habaſſia; He thereupon appointed them a Reſidence in a place near the <hi>Lake of Dembea:</hi> The Fathers having thanked him for his kind offer, told him, <hi>That they would be better ſatisfied if he would be pleaſed to order their former Reſidence at</hi> Gorgora, <hi>which had been taken from them after they had built a Church there, to be reſtored to them again;</hi> which he ordered to be done preſently, commanding them <hi>to write to Father</hi> Peter,

            <p>Father <hi>Tellez,</hi> though he would not take upon him to decide who had the beſt Title to the Crown, <hi>Jacob</hi> or <hi>Suſeneus,</hi> ſets down what was to be ſaid on both ſides: <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>was undoubtedly nigheſt to the Crown in the Royal Line, in being the Son of</hi> Malac Saged, <hi>who was
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:57883:150"/>Emperor; he had beſides been Emperor himſelf for Seven years, and that with the Approbation of the People, who had alſo reſtored him after he had been Depoſed for ſome time; neither was his being a Baſtard any bar to him, ſince according to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and Civil Law, a Baſtard may ſucceed his Father, as</hi> John <hi>the Firſt of</hi> Portugal <hi>did his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> Don Peter; <hi>beſides,</hi> Suſeneus <hi>was a Baſtard no leſs than</hi> Jacob.

They were no ſooner arrived, but the Emperor gave them an Audience, and after that was over, ordered
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:57883:150"/>them to Dine with him, that is, in the ſame Room, though not at the ſame Table.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Portugueſes</hi> give a tedious account of the particulars of this Entertainment; the main of which are, That the Emperor does not feed himſelf, but has his Meat put into his Mouth by his Pages; that his Diet was plain, and without any thing of Cookery; and that he had neither Knife, Spoon, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-Cloth, nor Napkin, and had Bread for his Trencher; and never Drank till he had done Eating.</p>
            <p>Father <hi>Peter</hi> and his Companions never miſſed the Emperor's <hi>Levee,</hi> the Emperor ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king great delight to diſcourſe with them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Religion, and the difference that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Habaſſin</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Churches; which Conferences having continued for ſome time,

                     <hi>We have for a long time had a great affection for the Chriſtians of your parts, upon the account of the benefits this Empire received from them when it was formerly reſcued by the</hi> Portugueſes <hi>out of the hands of</hi> Mahometans, <hi>and reſtored by them to its ancient eſtate and quiet; moſt of whoſe Race died in our Father's Reign, who was willing they ſhould enjoy what his Anceſtors had given them; whereupon ſo ſoon as, through God's Grace, I took the Government of the Empire upon me, I determined to renew our Alliance with the Faithful People of Chriſt, in order to remedy the manifeſt diſtractions our Empire of late years has been put into by the</hi> Mahometans; <hi>for notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding we have ſubdued moſt of our Domeſtick Enemies, we have Enemies ſtill that are much more Powerful, that is, the</hi> Infidel Gauls, <hi>who have Conquered a great part of our Empire, and deſtroyed many of our Churches, and which is worſt of all, are daily Invading us, and exerciſing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard-of Cruelties on Old Men, Widows, and

                  <p>
                     <hi>The principal cauſe of my writing to your Majeſty at this time, is to renew the Familiarity and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence which was between our Anceſtors; which Friendſhip, together with the Adoption of the Holy Spirit, has much enobled us. Wherefore we deſire
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:57883:152"/>your Majeſty, to ſend us ſome ſtrong and ſtout Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, to help us to beat the Enemy out of our Ports; your Troops when they arrive will find us provided with Arms, and all other neceſſary Proviſions of War, and in a readineſs to aſſiſt them to the utmoſt: It being much fitter that thoſe Ports ſhould be in your Majeſty's hands, than in the hands of the greateſt Enemies of our holy Faith; your Majeſty's Anceſtors ſent an Army of Gallant men into</hi> Ethiopia <hi>at a time when the Enemy was ready to have deſtroy'd our Faith, and Empire. We might deſtroy all our Enemies with great eaſe, if we were aſſiſted by the powerful Kings that profeſs the Goſpel; and who do comfort our hearts with the Memory of heavenly things, we being</hi> all Sons of Heaven, <hi>as St.</hi> John <hi>witneſſeth, ſaying,</hi> What is born of the fleſh is fleſh, and what is born of the Spirit is Spirit. <hi>Furthermore we are at war with another Enemy, who are called</hi> Gauls, <hi>and who do give us much trouble: Wherefore we beſeech your Majeſty to ſend us ſome ſtout Troops, and ſuch as are Zealous for our holy Apoſtolical Faith, and that with all poſſible Expedition: We on our part have for ſome time been ready to receive them; and if they were once come, it will quickly appear, that all that we deſign is feaſible. For why, ſince Chriſt our Lord is our Common Head, and we are all his Members, and the Heavenly Father hath begot us all in one Womb of Baptiſm, and that not with corruptible ſeed, ſhould we not be all tied in one chain of love with one Soul and one Body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If theſe Letters were writ by the <hi>Habaſſin</hi> Emperor, which I do very much doubt, they plainly diſcover that the Fathers chief Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:57883:153"/>to perſuade him to ſubmit himſelf to the Pope, was the promiſe of <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Troops; but the reaſon why I ſuſpect theſe Letters not to have been writ by the Emperor, but by ſome Miſſionary in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and who had never ſo much as been in <hi>Ethïopia,</hi> are, 1. <hi>That</hi> Seltam Saged, <hi>or</hi> Suſeneus<hi>'s Father, was never Emperor, as he is ſaid in theſe Letters to have been.</hi> 2. Guerreiro, <hi>in his relation of</hi> Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia, <hi>printed at</hi> Lisbon <hi>in the Year</hi> 1611, <hi>ſets them down under the name of the Emperor</hi> Jacob,
<note place="margin">Theſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were probably forged by ſome Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionary.</note> 
                     <hi>or</hi> Malaſequet. 3. <hi>Their Phraſeology, excepting an affected ſprinkling here and there of uncouth Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as alſo their Complements are ſo much</hi> Spaniſh, <hi>that an</hi> Habaſſin <hi>has not leſs of the air of a</hi> Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard, <hi>than they have of the Letters that were certainly known to have been writ by ſome of thoſe Emperors.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>Pereira</hi> tells us, <hi>That the</hi> Habaſſin <hi>Emperors from the time that the remains of</hi> Gama<hi>'s Troops went over to the</hi> Turks, <hi>and aſſiſted them againſt</hi> Ademas, <hi>dreaded nothing ſo much, as the coming of</hi> Portugueſe <hi>Soldiers from the</hi> Indies; <hi>but whatever the Emperors did, there being nothing that the</hi> Jeſuits <hi>deſired ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, it is to be feared, that they made bold with the Emperor's name in the ſolliciting of them.</hi>

                     <hi>Hear, Sir, My Father was always a great friend to the</hi> Portugueſes <hi>that came into theſe parts, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving continually favoured them in all things, as I have done ever ſince his death, having on all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions aſſiſted them both with my Intereſt and my Purſe; and ſaved ſeveral of them when condemned to die, being willing to preſerve the remains of the firſt</hi> Portugueſes <hi>that came among us, until more ſhould come to them for the good of this Empire.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>I have had it for ſome years in my thoughts to write to you, but have ſtill been hindered by the Wars we have of late been ſo much embroiled in, out of which God has been pleaſed to deliver us at laſt, and to give us an Emperor of a Sound Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and who governs all things with great pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, who upon my acquainting him with the great need we ſtand in of</hi> Portugueſe <hi>Succors, was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to write himſelf to the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> for ſome, commanding me to do the ſame, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him, how much we deſire them, and how much their coming will be for God's Service. I muſt therefore intreat your Excellency, to lend us
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:57883:154"/>your helping-hand in this affair, that ſo it may be brought to a ſpeedy Iſſue; Let there be at leaſt a Thouſand Soldiers ſent, and let it be done with all poſſible Expedition, for which Service you will have honour in the ſight of God, who will undoubtedly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward you for it; and were there but once a way opened for it, your Excellency ſhall want nothing that this Empire affords.

            <p>Had the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> been ſo kind as to have publiſhed thoſe Letters of Father <hi>Peter,</hi> that theſe refer to, we might then probably have known the true cauſe of that Father's having left <hi>Za Danguil</hi>'s Court ſo abruptly as he did; but however that were, it is plain from what <hi>Athenateus</hi> writes of the Father's being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted <hi>with all his Secrets,</hi> ſo as to be able to <hi>diſcloſe his whole heart</hi> to the Viceroy, that they two had been plotting together; ſo that had the Thouſand <hi>Portugueſes Athenateus</hi> wrote for ſo earneſtly, come, it is more than probable that he would have made uſe of them for his own Service; the getting the Ports of <hi>Matzua</hi> and <hi>Arkiko</hi> into the hands of the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſes,</hi> and the erecting of <hi>Tigre</hi> by their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance into a Kingdom Independent of that of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> being a thing the Fathers even when moſt in favour with the Emperors, were continually labouring to bring about: For <hi>Athenateus</hi> was not only never in favour with the Emperor, whoſe name he made uſe of in
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:57883:155"/>theſe Letters, but on the contrary, as the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits</hi> themſelves confeſs, he was reduced by him to the Miſerable condition of a <hi>probre eſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dero,</hi> or <hi>poor Waiting-man:</hi> Neither is it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely that it was <hi>Athenateus</hi> having ruined himſelf and his Family, by intrieguing with the Fathers, that made him when he was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Death-bed reject their Aſſiſtance when they offered themſelves to him; and that with indignation; <hi>not caring, it is like, to have any thing more to do with people that had deceived him ſo often. Tho to do the Fathers Juſtice, it was none of their fault that the Soldiers did not come by the firſt fair wind after they had promiſed them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Habaſſin</hi> Empire, notwithſtanding all its late great bleedings, <hi>was too full of bad humours to continue long quiet:</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Mock Emperor ſet up and Murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> For <hi>Seltam Saged</hi> was not well warm in his Throne, when a Fellow <hi>of baſe extraction</hi> was ſet up for the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Jacob;</hi> and though he is ſaid not to have reſembled him in the leaſt, either <hi>in Face or Perſon,</hi> yet he <hi>acted</hi> him ſo well, that he was followed by vaſt Multitudes. This <hi>Perkin,</hi> after having coſt <hi>Ethiopia a vaſt quantity of blood,</hi> was killed at laſt by ſome of the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees of his own Party, <hi>being grown weary of maintaining a Mock Prince at ſo great a charge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Father <hi>Peter</hi> is ſaid to have made himſelf very Popular on this occaſion, by having perſuaded the Emperor to pardon all the <hi>Common People,</hi> and moſt of the <hi>Nobles</hi> that had been engaged in this Rebellion; as likewiſe to Pardon a great herd of Peaſants, who had provoked him
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:57883:155"/>more by their <hi>Rudeneſs and Inſolence,</hi> than by their having <hi>taken up Arms againſt him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Emperor having thus rid his hands of his Sham-Rival, removed his Camp from <hi>Coja,</hi>

<note place="margin">A particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador's Journey.</note> they begun their Journey in the beginning of <hi>March</hi> 1613, going firſt to <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jam,</hi> where they were kindly entertain'd for ſome time by the Viceroy; beſides their <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſin</hi> Retinue, they were attended by Ten <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſes;</hi> Six whereof were to accompany them only to the Kingdom of <hi>Narea,</hi> but the other Four were to go with them to the <hi>Indies.</hi> On the Fifth of <hi>March</hi> they departed from <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brana</hi> with a ſtrong Guard; and having Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled Weſtward two days, they arrived at <hi>Sinaſſe,</hi> the chief Town of <hi>Gongas;</hi> where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the Viceroy's name, demanded a Guard to conduct them to the <hi>Nile,</hi> it was deni'd them by the Infidels, the Natives of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey being all ſuch: Whereupon they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched a Courier preſently to the Viceroy to acquaint them therewith, who immediately ordered three Companies of Soldiers to March to <hi>Sinaſſe;</hi> and after having Conveyed the Ambaſſadors ſafe to <hi>Nile,</hi> in their return to
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:57883:160"/>chaſtiſe the <hi>Gongazians</hi> for their Inſolence; but the Infidels having had Intelligence how much the Viceroy reſented their diſobedience, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to pacify him, gave the Ambaſſadors a Guard, which waited upon them to <hi>Minaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet,</hi> a Town that ſtands upon the wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which the <hi>Nile</hi> makes towards <hi>Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Embaſſadors paſſed that River which was very high at that time, upon <hi>Borachoes</hi> or hides full of Wind: After which they Travelled directly South till they came to the Kingdom of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea,</hi> whoſe Borders are about Fifty Leagues diſtant from that River. The <hi>Cafres,</hi> who are the Natives, though ſubject to the <hi>Habaſſin,</hi> diſturbed them ſo much in their Journey, that they were forced to purchaſe a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage through the Countrey with trifling Preſents.</p>
            <p>Being arrived at <hi>Gondas,</hi> they were kindly entertained by the Governor, to whom the Viceroy had recommended them as his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular friends.
<note place="margin">They induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly are ſent out of their way.</note> 
               <hi>Narea</hi> is the moſt Southern Countrey of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and is about Thirty or Forty Leagues in compaſs; its Inhabitants are reckoned to be the beſt and honeſteſt ſort of people in the whole <hi>Habaſſin</hi> Empire; they are well Shaped, and not very Black, and have thin Lips and long Noſes; the Countrey is Fertile and Populous, and its chief Trade is in Slaves, in the Buying and Selling of whom its Merchants are ſaid to be wonderfully ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt. They were firſt Converted to Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity by <hi>Malac Saged,</hi> to which they had always been well diſpoſed.</p>
            <pb n="295" facs="tcp:57883:160"/>
            <p>From <hi>Gonda</hi> the Embaſſadors went in Six days to the place where the <hi>Xuma</hi> or Viceroy of the Kingdom of <hi>Narea</hi> has his reſidence, by whom they were received very coldly, upon his being jealous that their buſineſs was <hi>to bring a</hi> Portugueſe <hi>Army into</hi> Ethiopia, <hi>to force them to turn</hi> Roman-<hi>Catholicks; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving called together all his Officers</hi> to conſult how to Defeat this pernicious deſign, it was agreed among them, that the beſt way to divert this ſtorm, was to perſuade the Embaſſadors to change their courſe, and to go to the <hi>Indies</hi> by the way of <hi>Baly,</hi> and the Cape of <hi>Darfuy,</hi> which they repreſented to be both the ſhorter and ſafer way than that the Court had Chaked out for them; knowing at the ſame time, that it would be impoſſible for them to Travel through the Countries which are in the road to <hi>Daffuy,</hi> ſeveral of them being ſubject to <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan</hi> Princes, who would not ſuffer any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Chriſtian, and much leſs Chriſtian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, to Travel through their Countries. <hi>Baly</hi> is a Kingdom that belonged formerly to the <hi>Habaſſin,</hi> but was then in the Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Mahometans</hi> and <hi>Gauls;</hi> it borders upon <hi>Adel,</hi> lying to the Eaſt of <hi>Narea</hi> ſo that the Embaſſadors in going that way, went back again in a manner; neither was the way that the Court had order'd them to take, much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by reaſon of the vaſt Deſerts, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Nations they were to have paſſed through before they got to <hi>Melinde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Viceroy having perſuaded them to go his way, was very officious to furniſh them with a Guard to conduct them out of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:57883:161"/>and to blind his deſign the more, ſent an Envoy to the King of <hi>Gingiro,</hi> through whoſe territories they were to paſs to obtain a free and ſafe paſſage for them. Being arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at the Banks of <hi>Zebee,</hi> which is a much bigger River than the <hi>Nile,</hi> and which running like a torrent amongſt ſteep Rocks, makes a moſt hideous noiſe, they met with a Bridge which was only a ſingle Plank reaching from one Rock to another, and which beſides that it was at a prodigious height from the water; it was ſo weak as to bend with the weight of one man; but there being no other Bridge, they were conſtrained to make uſe of this, and in a days time they all paſſed over it without loſing a man.</p>
            <p>Being now in the Kingdom of <hi>Gingiro,</hi> they halted at a Village not far from the Bridge, ſending the Viceroy's Envoy before, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the King of the Countrey with their arrival; but the King, who was a Heathen, was at that time ſo much employed in ſome extraordinary Conjurations, that it was a Week before the Envoy was permitted to ſpeak with him; but ſo ſoon as the Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was over, he gave him an audience, and ſent word by him to the Embaſſadors to come immediately to Court, promiſing to ſhew them all the kindneſs he was able.</p>
            <p>The Embaſſadors being come to Court, found the King ſitting on the top of a Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not unlike <hi>a Watch-Tower,</hi> it was <hi>Twenty five Palms</hi> in height, and about <hi>Thirty in breadth,</hi> the Courtiers ſtand all on the ground about it.</p>
            <pb n="297" facs="tcp:57883:161"/>
            <p>When the Embaſſadors offered to preſent the Emperor's Letters to the King,
<note place="margin">They are kindly received by the Comical King of <hi>Gingiro.</hi>
               </note> he came down from his Throne, and having received them with great Ceremony, he <hi>Skipped</hi> to the top of it again: <hi>For he is ſaid in all his poſtures, features, and motions, to have reſembled a Baboon much more than a Man.</hi> After he had read the Letters, he talked with the Embaſſadors a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time by an Interpreter, who repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both the King's Queſtions, and the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor's Anſwers with a moſt profound reverence, and at laſt diſmiſſed them with aſſurances of his being ready to do them all good Offices.</p>
            <p>The Embaſſadors having made the King a Preſent, obtained their <hi>Congè;</hi> and depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing next day, they came at night to a River, which they croſſed on <hi>Borachoes,</hi> that were puſhed to the other ſide by men Swimming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them,
<note place="margin">The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors are ſtopt by the Prince of <hi>Combute</hi> upon an intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of their not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been ſent by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror.</note> and directed by one that Swom before; when they had paſſed this River, they were in the Province of <hi>Combute,</hi> the Prince whereof is Tributary to the <hi>Habaſſin.</hi> They were kindly entertain'd by this Prince, till one <hi>Manquer</hi> came to his Court, who though he pretended to have no other buſineſs there, but <hi>to receive the tribute that Prince paid,</hi> yet he was really ſent by the Grandees of the Court; who having ſmelt out the ſecret of that Embaſſy, ordered him to follow it, and to ſtop it if he could poſſibly. In purſuance whereof <hi>Manquer,</hi> ſo ſoon as he had an opportunity whiſpered the King in the ear, <hi>That the Embaſſadors were not ſent by the Emperor, who knew nothing of them, but by another that was to be nameleſs;</hi> meaning no doubt <hi>Raz Cella,</hi> the Emperor's Brother, <hi>and
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:57883:162"/>that he ought not therefore to give any Credit to their Letters of Credence, which were all forged in the Emperor's name;</hi> That the buſineſs they were going to the <hi>Indies</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> about, was <hi>to bring an Army from thenee into</hi> Ethiopia, <hi>to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the people thereof to turn Papiſts, which Army was to be brought upon them through his Kingdom; ſo that he muſt expect to have the ſtorm they were going to raiſe, to fall firſt upon him. Amelinel,</hi> for that was the King's name, believing all that <hi>Manquer</hi> had told him, ſent preſently to the Embaſſadors to come and ſpeak with him; and having admitted them to his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, he told them roundly, that having been credibly informed, <hi>That they had no Commiſſion from the Emperor, he could not do leſs than ſtop them, till he had an anſwer from him whether they were his Embaſſadors or not;</hi> and though the Embaſſadors endeavoured to ſatisfy him preſently, by ſhewing him their <hi>Credentials;</hi> yet that would not do, but wait they muſt until <hi>Amelinel</hi> had the Emperor's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer by a Courier he intended to ſend to him. The Embaſſadors finding there was no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuading of <hi>Amelinel</hi> to let them go, deſired they might have leave to ſend a Courier of their own, with his, to the Court, which was granted them, but at the end of the third days Journey, the Couriers were both ſtopped; and after having been detained there Six Months, were ſent back without having ever been near the Court.</p>
            <p>But the Emperor, or his Brother, <hi>who I doubt was chiefly concerned in this Embaſſy,</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening to hear of the Embaſſador's being
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:57883:162"/>ſtopped, an <hi>angry Letter</hi> was writ thereupon to <hi>Amelinel</hi> in the Emperor's Name, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding him <hi>not only to permit the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to proceed on their Journey, but to furniſh them alſo with ſuch things as would be proper Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents for the Princes through whoſe Countries they were to paſs.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Amelinel having begg'd their Excellencies Pardon for having detained them ſo long, and treated them ſo rudely, upon a miſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation;</hi>
               <note place="margin">They are ſuffered to proceed on their Journey.</note> 
               <hi>and having furniſhed them with ſome fine Horſes for Preſents,</hi> he diſmiſſed them with a good guard, which he commanded not to leave them, till they ſaw them ſafe in the Kingdom of <hi>Alaba,</hi> whoſe Prince was a <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan,</hi> and had no dependance on the <hi>Habaſſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Ambaſſadors had not been Three days at that King's Court, whoſe Name was <hi>Alico,</hi> before their old friend <hi>Manquer</hi> was up with them again, who having told <hi>Alico</hi> the <hi>ſame ſtory</hi> he had told <hi>Amelinel,</hi> the <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> not troubling himſelf to examine whoſe Ambaſſadors they were, ordered <hi>their Perſons and Papers to be ſeized on preſently;</hi> but the Ambaſſadors having had notice that there was ſuch an Order preparing, had burnt all their Papers before the Officers came to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt them;
<note place="margin">They are thrown into Jayl by the King of <hi>Alaba,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſent home ſtripped.</note> and it was well for them they had; <hi>for had</hi> Alico <hi>had any other Evidence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides</hi> Manquer's <hi>word, That their buſineſs in the</hi> Indies <hi>was to bring an Army from thence through his Kingdom into</hi> Ethiopia, <hi>it would certainly have coſt them their lives; which though</hi> Alico <hi>ſpared for want of ſuch Evidence as their Papers would have furniſhed him withall, yet he ſtripped them of their Equipage, and ſent them back the
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:57883:163"/>way they came, in a very tattered condition. Were but the true ſecret of this Embaſſy known, we might know, its like too what it was that made the Emperor not long after this ſo jealous of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as to turn him out of all his Offices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding the Emperor did not as yet profeſs himſelf a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick, as his Brother did openly; yet it being obſerved by the Ambitious Courtiers,
<note place="margin">The Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that none but Papiſts were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, turn civil to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> 
               <hi>That none were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by him,</hi> or could <hi>pretend to any high poſt,</hi> but ſuch as had <hi>either turned,</hi> or appeared <hi>to be prepared to do it, whenever he ſhould give the word;</hi> they begun to Careſs the Fathers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly, making their court to them, <hi>by under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing their own Clergy as a pack of Hypocrites and Dunces, and by magnifying the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>as a Body, that it was an honour for any one to be a Member of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon Poperies growing thus faſhionable at Court,
<note place="margin">The Countrey is much alarm'd there with.</note> the <hi>Countrey, which is ſeldom fond of Court-faſhions,</hi> was ſo alarm'd by it, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan <hi>to roar</hi> againſt the Emperor and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at a moſt terrible rate, as bigotted <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that were reſolv'd to deſtroy the eſtabliſhed Religion by calling a Foreign Army in upon them; and the Fathers, as if the <hi>Habaſſins</hi> had <hi>not roared loud enough,</hi> to provoke them to <hi>roar louder,</hi> gave out a <hi>publick Challenge at this time to all the Learned of the</hi> Alexandrian <hi>Faith,</hi> if it had any ſuch, <hi>to defend their Religion, if they were able, before the Emperor.</hi> Which bold challenge <hi>being accepted,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Several publick Conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces about Religion.</note> there were divers <hi>publick Conferences about Religion held thereupon before the Emperor;</hi> In all which the Fathers, <hi>but by their own Brethren, are ſaid to have been
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:57883:163"/>Victorious,</hi> and by their great skill in <hi>School-Divinity, to whoſe ſubtleties the</hi> Habaſſins <hi>were utter ſtrangers, to have baffled them ſhamefully at every turn, to the admiration of the whole Court.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Monks and Fathers had done Diſputing, the Emperor, with the advice of <hi>his Cabinet Council,</hi>
               <note place="margin">An Edict is publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Emperor prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any to affirm that there is but one Nature in Chriſt. The <hi>Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> comes to Court, and is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences that had been held without his leave.</note> put forth a Proclamation <hi>prohibiting all his Subjects upon ſevere Penalties, to affirm that there is but one Nature in Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Abuna, Simon,</hi> hearing <hi>of the Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> that had been held at Court, and of the <hi>Proclamation</hi> they had ended in, made all the ſpeed he could thither, and being come to Court, he threatned the Emperor <hi>with an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication</hi> for having held <hi>publick Diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about Religion</hi> without his leave. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror endeavoured to <hi>pacify the angry Old Man,</hi> by telling him, That it was true that he had permitted <hi>ſome Conferences,</hi> but for no other end, but to remove a <hi>Schiſm that was in the Church; but now that be was come, he might, if he pleaſed, have the Conferences renewed again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Abuna,</hi> though <hi>his talent</hi> is ſaid not to have lain much that way, gave his Conſent to have the <hi>Diſputations</hi> renewed; and <hi>Learned Men</hi> having been appointed on both ſides to manage the Debate, the <hi>Fathers</hi> in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences did demonſtrate the <hi>Truth of Chriſt's having two Natures</hi> ſo evidently,
<note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences are renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before him.</note> from the <hi>Scriptures, Councils,</hi> and <hi>right Reaſon,</hi> that the <hi>Habaſſins</hi> had nothing that was <hi>material</hi> to ſay againſt it, the <hi>Abuna</hi> himſelf not having offered one word in defence of his Faith, when he ſaw his Monks moſt miſerably baffled.</p>
            <pb n="232" facs="tcp:57883:164"/>
            <p>It is remarkable, That it was the policy of the Jeſuits to make the <hi>Doctrine of Chriſt's ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving two Natures, and not that of the Pope's Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,</hi> againſt which, by what the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Claudius</hi> did, we know the <hi>Habaſſins had enough to ſay, the point that was debated in all their publick Conferences,</hi> which was not ſo proper, <hi>conſidering that the</hi> Habaſſins <hi>might have believed that Doctrine, as the Reformed and Greek Churches do, without being the nearer to the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>for it;</hi> for it does not at all follow, That <hi>becauſe Chriſt had two Natures, that the Pope muſt therefore he his Vicar upon Earth;</hi> and <hi>that all Chriſtian Churches muſt ſubmit themſelves to him:</hi> The very Fathers that <hi>eſtabliſhed that Doctrine</hi> in the Council of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> having denied that the <hi>Pope had any Supremacy, but what he owed to</hi> Rome<hi>'s being the firſt City is the</hi> Roman <hi>Empire;</hi> as I have obſerved elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
            <p>Upon the <hi>Habaſſins</hi> being thus baffled upon a point <hi>the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>was no more concerned in than the Church of</hi> England, the Fathers in the heat of their triumph, did <hi>drive on the Emperor at a moſt furious rate,</hi> perſuading him to ſet forth another Proclamation, <hi>making it death for any one to deny that there are two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in Chriſt:</hi> But the <hi>Abuna,</hi> though he had little to ſay for <hi>his Religion</hi> at the Conferences,
<note place="margin">The <hi>Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> leaves the Court in wrath, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates the Emperor.</note> endeavoured after he had left the Court, to make <hi>amends for his ſilence there, by roaring the louder through the Countrey as he went home;</hi> and being ſenſible that beſides the whole body of the People, he had the Emperor's Mother, and his half-brother <hi>Emana Chriſtos,</hi> with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:57883:164"/>other Grandees on his ſide; he was no ſooner got home, then he thundered out an Excommunication againſt all, not except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Emperor, that had, or ſhould ſubmit themſelves to the Pope.</p>
            <p>The Emperor was at firſt troubled at this <hi>Cenſure;</hi>

<pb n="304" facs="tcp:57883:165"/>
               <hi>the Aſſociation that was going on,</hi> was very angry with the <hi>Abuna,</hi> wiſhing he had him in his hands to put a ſtop to his enflaming his Subjects againſt him; but knowing that if he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered himſelf to be diſpleaſed with him, that he would either not come if he ſent for him, or come with ſuch a Guard, that it would not be ſafe for him to offer him any violence, he thought fit to <hi>diſſemble his paſſion ſo far,</hi> as to write a kind Letter to him, deſiring <hi>him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to him with all poſſible ſpeed, to ſatisfy ſome ſcruples which gave him great diſturbance;</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the ſame time to Father <hi>Peter to come likewiſe;</hi> which the Father did immediately, bringing with him the news of the <hi>Perſecution</hi> that was ſet on ſoot in <hi>Tigre</hi> againſt the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and their Converts.</p>
            <p>The Queen and ſeveral Grandees of the Court ſeeing what a <hi>ſtorm</hi> the Emperor was like to raiſe by endeavouring to introduce Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery into his Empire, waited upon him in a body,

All which paſſionate Remonſtances were ſo far from ſhaking the Emperor's Zeal <hi>for the introducing of Popery,</hi> that they inflamed it to that Degree, that he one day told Father <hi>Peter, That notwithſtanding he was ſenſible he had ſo far loſt the hearts of his Subjects by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour he ſhewed to the</hi> Roman <hi>Religion, that they
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:57883:165"/>were all ready to rebel againſt him;</hi> nevertheleſs <hi>he was reſolved either to loſe his Crown,</hi>

And as for his Brother, whenever he was ſpoke to <hi>to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Popery,</hi> and <hi>return to his former Faith;</hi> his anſwer was ſtill, <hi>While I have breath in my body I will defend the</hi> Roman <hi>Faith with my Sword, my Tongue, and my Pen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Abuna,</hi> that he might not ſeem to be wanting to his duty in ſuch a critical juncture,
<note place="margin">The <hi>Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> being invited to Court, goes thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther well guarded.</note> reſolved to go and wait on the Emperor, but with ſuch a Train, that it ſhould not be ſafe for him, if he had a mind to it, to meddle with him, the very Monks that attended him being more in number than the Royal Army. The <hi>Abuna</hi> and his Monks when they came within hearing of the Emperor's Tent, gave <hi>a general ſhout, That they came all prepared to die for the faith of their Forefathers, being reſolved to hear no more arguments againſt it;</hi> making the whole Camp to ring with <hi>Ajentent, Ajentent,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>The Ancient, the Ancient,</hi> meaning their Faith.</p>
            <p>The Emperor being willing to put a ſtop to this fury, ſent to the <hi>Abuna</hi> to come to him; which the <hi>Abuna</hi> did; and having ſpoke their minds very freely to one another, they agreed <hi>to ſummon a Convocation of the Clergy to meet on</hi> Michaelmas-day, at which the Fathers were to be preſent, and to be heard.</p>
            <p>The Convocation being met at the time appointed, it was ſo far from <hi>allaying the heat</hi> of the <hi>Habaſſins,</hi> which was the end for which the Emperor had called it, that it put them in <hi>a greater flame</hi> than they were in before; for
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:57883:166"/>the Fathers knowing they had not one <hi>voice</hi> on their ſide in that whole body, were not for having things put <hi>to the Vote,</hi> but for having them <hi>diſputed,</hi> as <hi>if it had not been a Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but only a publick Conference;</hi> but though the Fathers offered ſeveral Arguments in defence of their Doctrines, which the <hi>Habaſſins</hi> did not ſo much as pretend to Anſwer: Nevertheleſs the <hi>Habaſſin</hi> ſtill kept their Ground, declaring, <hi>That no Sophiſtry ſhould ever perſuade them out of the faith of their Forefathers.</hi> The Convocation having wrangled, for that was all the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> would ſuffer to be done in it for five days; it broke up in a great heat, <hi>leaving matters a great deal worſe than it found them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Abuna</hi> and his Monks finding there was no good to be done upon the Emperor,
<note place="margin">The <hi>Abuna</hi> and the Monks wait on the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in a Body.</note> who ſeemed to be bewitched by the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> were for leaving the Camp immediately without taking any farther notice of him; but having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered on't a little better, they agreed to wait upon him in a body, to conjure him by all that was ſacred, and as he loved himſelf, his Poſterity and People, not to endeavour to bring a new Religion in among them; and which, he could not but be ſenſible, was the Religion in the world that they the moſt hated; and ſo without ſending to him for an audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which they had reaſon to believe would have been denied them, they went and threw themſelves at his feet, and inſtead of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, raiſed <hi>a moſt lamentable howl,</hi> as if they had been ſo many <hi>Ideots,</hi> ſay the Fathers; which <hi>howl,</hi> having continued a good ſpace, they at laſt recovered their ſpeech, <hi>crying</hi> with one
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:57883:166"/>Voice, That his Highneſs <hi>must not think that he was able to deſtroy a Religion which had been maintained in</hi> Ethiopia <hi>by ſo many Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors thorough ſo many Ages.</hi>

            <p>This Proclamation brought the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey in to <hi>Julius,</hi> out of which having formed a numerous <hi>Croiſade,</hi> he marched directly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Nile</hi> with an intention to have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len firſt upon <hi>Raz Cella,</hi> the great Champion

            </p>
            <p>The Emperor hearing that <hi>Julius</hi> was Marching towards him with a numerous and Zealous <hi>Croiſade,</hi> ſent to his Brother to make all the haſte he could to come and join him with his Army; but fearing leſt <hi>Julius,</hi> who made long Marches, might be up with him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Brother could join him; He incamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

            <p>This Impious Proclamation, as the <hi>Habaſſins</hi> reckoned it, produced a bitter Libel, directed by way of a Letter to the Emperor, wherein he was told, <hi>That his Subjects were all amazed at his wickedneſs in commanding</hi> the violation <hi>of that Sacred day; adviſing him not to be rid by the</hi> Jeſuits,

            <pb n="313" facs="tcp:57883:169"/>
            <p>This Libel <hi>galled</hi> the Emperor ſo terribly, that to be <hi>revenged</hi> on its Authors, he publiſhed a Second Proclamation, by which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all his Subjects to work on Saturdays, being to pay a Crown for the firſt fault,

               </note> and to forfeit their whole Eſtate for the ſecond; to which penalty the Offenders were to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue liable Seven Years after the fault was committed, by which time the Fathers hoped <hi>that Popery might have got ſtrength enough in</hi> Ethiopia <hi>to execute this Law as they ſhould ſee oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, being ſenſible that there would be few or none of any Eſtate that would not be under its laſh.</hi> This rigorous Proclamation being ſent to <hi>Joanel</hi> the Viceroy of <hi>Begameder,</hi> who waited for ſuch an opportunity to raiſe the people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Emperor, to publiſh, he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to be done preſently with great Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, taking care at the ſame time, to declare to all the World, that it was what he abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from his Soul: Neither was <hi>Joanel</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in his thoughts of the effects of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation; for the people no ſooner heard of the Emperor's having commanded them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſevere Penalties for <hi>to work upon Saturdays,</hi> than they began to rail at him, as one who <hi>had no Religion;</hi> and who, for that and other reaſons was become ſo <hi>intolerable to his Subjects, that they muſt be Beaſts of Burden to endure him any longer;</hi> and hearing that <hi>Joanel</hi> had declared himſelf openly in all Companies againſt what the Emperor had commanded;
<note place="margin">A Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on breaks out upon it.</note> they flocked to him from all Quarters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching him as <hi>he had any love for God and his Countrey, not to ſuffer their Religion to be thus

When the news of this ſecond <hi>Croiſade</hi> came to Court, great numbers of the firſt Quality of both Sexes ſet upon the Emperor again,
<note place="margin">An ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs is made to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror not to trouble his people with Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.</note> beſeeching him <hi>as he loved himſelf and his Empire, to give over all thoughts of introducing Popery into a Countrey, that of all things in the world could not endure it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Emperor, though much troubled to find that <hi>Joanel</hi> and his Cauſe had ſo many friends in his Court; yet not being willing to do any thing that might <hi>intimmedate his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſers are puniſhed.</note> he told the Grandees that had addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to him, with an angry countenance, <hi>That it was his Subjects duty to obey, and not to diſpute his Commands; and that he would teach them bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter manners than to fly thus in their Prince's face, when he did any thing that diſpleaſed them;</hi> and hoping to have terrifi'd the Grandees from troubling him with any more Addreſſes, he commanded <hi>one of the most forward Addreſſers to be put to death,</hi> baniſhing another of them for his life to the Kingdom of <hi>Narea;</hi> which cruelty was ſo far from having the effect that

            </p>
            <p>The Emperor, though he could not but ſee the ſtorm thicken upon him on all ſides, yet was ſo far from ſeeking to divert it by <hi>any Compliances,</hi> that having called a full Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the Grandees, Monks, and Military Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers together in the great Hall of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, he made the following Speech to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>YOU Ris againſt the Emperor</hi> Jacob, <hi>and having Depoſed him for ſeveral Miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanors,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's Speech thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> 
               <hi>you advanced my Couſin</hi> Za Danguil <hi>to the Throne, whom for having forſaken your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and embraced that of the</hi> Portugueſes, <hi>you afterwards Murthered; and after having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the Crown upon me, you made</hi> Jacob <hi>King a Second time; but though you intended to have Depoſed me, God was pleaſed to give me Victory; from that day to this I have done wrong to no body, but on the contrary, have pardoned great numbers, having been prodigal of my favours to a fault; but all this has not been ſufficient to keep you from Rebelling, upon a pretence that I am endeavouring to deſtroy your Religion, when, in truth, I do only ſeek to reform it; for as I do profeſs with you, That our Lord Chriſt is true God and true Man; ſo I do moreover affirm, That as he cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect God without having the Nature of God, ſo neither can he be perfect Man without a Human Nature; now ſince it is evident by the light of reaſon, That the Divine and Human Nature are really diſtinguiſhed, it muſt follow therefore, that there are two Natures in Chriſt; and ſince there
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:57883:171"/>can be no Confuſion in the Godhead, thoſe two Natures muſt neceſſarily be united in one and the ſame Perſon of the Eternal Word; ſo that what I am doing, is not to forſake the Faith, but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it in truth. And I do further affirm, That the Divine Nature is Superior to the Human. It is true, I have forbid you to obſerve</hi> Saturday <hi>any longer; and it is an amazing thing that you who value your ſelves upon being Chriſtians, ſhould be for keeping the Sabbath of the Jews; what is this, but, as the Prophet</hi> Elias <hi>ſaid,</hi> to go halt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>&amp;c.? As this is my Faith, ſo I do not follow it becauſe it is the Faith of the</hi> Portugueſes, <hi>or of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, but becauſe it is the Faith that was eſtabliſhed by Six hundred Fathers in the Council of</hi> Calcedon, <hi>which Condemn'd</hi> Dioſcorus <hi>and</hi> Eutyches; <hi>and for being a truth founded on the Scriptures, and derived from the Apoſtles, who were the Teachers of the World. Undeceive your ſelves therefore; for for this Faith I am ready to lay down my life if there ſhould be occaſion, though I muſt tell you at the ſame time, it ſhall coſt them their Lives firſt that ſhall dare to contradict me therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How ſeaſonable a Speech of this ſtrain, was, in which Father <hi>Peter,</hi> who was now become the firſt Miniſter, had a hand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, for one in the Emperor's Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, let the world judge.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>I <hi>Write this with the good News of this Kingdom, to your Reverence, to engage you to order</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions to be made, <hi>and to</hi> have Maſſes ſaid, <hi>and the</hi> Te Deum ſung, <hi>to return Thanks to God for the favour he has ſhewed us</hi> in the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this Empire, <hi>the doing whereof will very much refreſh the Fathers and Brethren who labour here with me, and will ſweeten the great hardſhips they undergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Emperor with his whole Court, and all the Grandees, and Princes Eccleſiaſtical and Secular of this Empire, have abjured their Errors, and made a publick Profeſſion of their Obedience to the holy See of</hi> Rome.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The general Adminiſtration of all Churches and Pariſhes being put into my hands, I have Eſtabliſhed Curates in them all, having made ſuch new Laws as were neceſſary; and aboliſhed all the old ones that were contrary to the</hi> Roman <hi>Church. I have had ſome thoughts of coming to you, and have been ready to begin my Journey, but have been ſtill hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the Glory of God, which obligeth me to keep cloſe to the Emperor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The thing we ſtand moſt in need of here at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, is a Patriarch, with a good number of Fathers, to help us to carry on theſe good beginnings. Your
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:57883:173"/>Reverence cannot but be ſenſible of this our want, without my enlarging upon it. Our Fathers and Brethren ought to run thorough fire and water, Pikes and Swords for to aſſiſt this Countrey; lest having the promiſed Land ſhewed us, we may be excluded it thorough our own fault. They ought to flock hither with all poſſible ſpeed; for notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Heirs apparent of the Empire, and all the Princes and Nobles thereof are at preſent true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks; Nevertheleſs ſhould we happen to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the Emperor and his Brother</hi> Zela Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtos <hi>by death, it is to be feared, that the Monks and</hi> Habaſſins <hi>might raiſe ſeditions to the pulling down of all that we have built; and may perſuade the people, who are more changeable than the wind, to abandon what they have ſo lately embraced.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wherefore your Reverence would do well to ſend us all the Fathers you can ſpare; let them be at leaſt Twenty, whom we ſhall endeavour to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate the beſt we can, until it ſhall pleaſe God to raiſe up a Cardinal or Prince to have compaſſion upon theſe poor people, and to ſuccor thoſe who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in their Converſion. No day paſſeth wherein the Emperor do's not ſpeak to us to ſend for Two hundred Fathers, ſaying,</hi> God will provide for them when they come. <hi>I am ſenſible the Society cannot furniſh us with ſo many, though if it could, the Corn here is ſo ripe for the Harveſt, that they would all find work enough. We did at firſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate our ſelves to the customs of the Countrey, that we might with the more eaſe gain them to the Lord; having beſides the Faſts that are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, kept</hi> Wedneſdays, <hi>and obſerved</hi> Lent, <hi>and</hi> Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, <hi>and the other principal Feasts, according to their ſtile; according to which,</hi> Eaſter <hi>falls ſometimes a
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:57883:174"/>Month ſooner than with us; reciting our Offices likewiſe after their cuſtom on the Evening of Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-days; but ſo ſoon as we found them diſpoſed for it, we propoſed to them the Rites, Cuſtoms, and Ceremonies of the</hi> Latin-<hi>Church, and the decrees of the Pope, which they have now univerſallly agreed to; ſo that of late we have without any contradiction, kept</hi> Eaſter, <hi>and the other Feaſts, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the</hi> Roman <hi>ſtile. For the ſettlement whereof, they have earneſtly demanded the Tables of our Moveable Feaſts, and the Eccleſiaſtical Epact, to prevent their being miſtaken. I have by Letter deſired our Provincial to ſend us ſuch Tables, that any one of a common capacity may accommodate the names that are in them, to the names of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. To which end I have ſent him a Table that was made here by a Catholick, who is very expert in Arithmetick, that he may examine it, and alter it as he ſhall think convenient. And I do earneſtly beſeech your Reverence, to get this affair diſpatched as ſoon as it is poſſible, and to order continual Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to be made to God in our behalf, and in behalf of this Countrey: We have loſt two good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers here; God take us under his Protection; for this Miſſion has ſuſtained a great loſs by their deaths; this Empire, which wants I do not know how many Prieſts, at preſent has only, Father</hi> James Matos, <hi>and Father</hi> Anthony Bruno, <hi>who have the ſole charge of</hi> Gojam; <hi>and Father</hi> Lewis d' Azeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, <hi>who is gone lately to</hi> Ambra; <hi>and my ſelf, who am fixt at Court. Praiſed be God we are all in health at preſent; but Father</hi> Lewis<hi>'s or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary diſtempers are ſuch as demand a writ of eaſe for him; but Charity and a Zeal for Souls over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes all difficulties; I do recommend my ſelf

The Abuna</hi> Chriſtos Dula <hi>kept ſeveral Concubines, contrary to the cuſtom of Patriarchs, as was well known by all his Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraries, and by ſome that are ſtill alive. His
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:57883:177"/>Succeſſor</hi> Peter <hi>kept a</hi> Malaquis <hi>Wife, and having been convicted of Adultery, he did Penance for it, as may be teſtified by ſeveral living Witneſſes, namely one</hi> Joſeph, <hi>and one</hi> Marino, <hi>who are both Strangers, and not</hi> Habaſſins; <hi>and who adding ſin to ſin, did Excommunicate the Emperor</hi> Jacob, <hi>after he had Reigned Seven Years, as he did all the People of</hi> Ethiopia <hi>likewiſe, in caſe they did not Depoſe him, and Baniſh him to the Kingdom of</hi> Narea; <hi>and having placed</hi> Za Danguil <hi>in the Throne, he afterwards excited his Subjects to Murther him, by Excommunicating them if they did not do it; and as if all this had not been enough, he took the Field with the Emperor</hi> Jacob <hi>againſt us, and was killed with him in the Fight. The Abuna</hi> Simon <hi>was guilty likewiſe of divers enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Grimes, who beſides his having taken one</hi> Mali <hi>an</hi> Egyptian<hi>'s Wife from him, and diſhonoured ſeveral Virgins, he kept divers Concubines, and happening to have a Child by one who was not able to maintain it, to conceal his ſhame, he ordered it to be thrown to the Wolves, by whom it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured; this every body knows to be true, namely, the</hi> Azages; <hi>and who, when</hi> Julius <hi>Rebelled, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of labouring, according to the cuſtom of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs and Monks, to make Peace, joyned with him in his Rebellion, and having called his Soldiers together, told them on the day before the Battel, That he forgave them all, Young and Old, their Sins, notwithſtanding they had broke all the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendments, upon condition they would put all to the Sword that they found in Arms in the Emperor's Camp, and that he would Canonize the Man that would kill the Emperor, aſſuring them that all that ſhould be ſlain ſighting againſt him, would die Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:57883:178"/>and go ſtraightways to Heaven; encouraging</hi> Julius<hi>'s Soldiers, after the example of Satan, to fight againſt us; but God was pleaſed to give us the Victory; and the Divine Juſtice having laid its Military hands upon him, he died an ill death. But to return to our chief intent, theſe Patriarchs in having, from the time of</hi> Dioſcorus, <hi>denied Obedience to the Popes of</hi> Rome, <hi>who are the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors of St.</hi> Peter, <hi>the foundation of the Faith, and the Head of the Holy Church; and in having affirmed that there is only One Nature in Chriſt, and in having refuſed the Ordinances and Canons of the Apoſtles of our Lord, and wreſted all wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings to their own wicked purpoſes, have not lead the People in the paths of Truth: Let us therefore give over yeilding Obedience any longer to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs of</hi> Alexandria, <hi>who are all</hi> Jacobites, <hi>walking in the ways of their Errors, and treading in the ſteps of</hi> Arius, Macedonius, Sabellius, Eutyches, <hi>and</hi> Dioſcorus, <hi>and let us yeild Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>who ſits in the Chair of St.</hi> Peter, <hi>which Chair cannot Err in any matter of Faith or good Manners. And do you all in Peace follow the Holy Faith, which Chriſt our Lord built with his Holy Blood on the Croſs, which he ſhed for the Salvation of all that do believe in him, for ever and ever.</hi> Amen.</p>

            <p>This Manifeſto, notwithſtanding it is Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox as to what relates to the two Natures in Chriſt, yet its throwng ſo much dirt, and in all probability unjuſtly, on the Memories of the <hi>Habaſſin</hi> Abuna's, was a thing infinitely below the Dignity, as well as Charity of a Chriſtian Emperor, who let his Religion be
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:57883:178"/>what it will, is <hi>not to write Libels, but to burn them rather, as</hi> Conſtantine <hi>did.</hi> And as to the policy of ſuch a Manifeſto at this time, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Emperor's Affairs were in ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that it was ſafe for him <hi>to provoke his Subjects to Rebel, that ſo by ſubduing them, he might deſtroy the eſtabliſhed Religion with the more caſe, it was certainly ſtark naught,</hi> there being nothing that he could have done, that could have enraged his People more againſt him, than the <hi>making of ſuch lew'd reflections on Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, for whoſe Memories the</hi> Habaſſins <hi>had a moſt profound veneration; but ſuch blunders as theſe are to be expected in places where Princes Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils are governed by People who have ſpent moſt of their days in a Cell, under the diſcipline of a blind Obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Emperor about this time finding that notwithſtanding he had enraged his Subjects almoſt to a madneſs againſt him by his Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſto's and Proclamations in favour of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<note place="margin">The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror grows jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of his Brother.</note> that his Brother <hi>Raz Cella</hi> was ſtill court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Party as their Head, ſo that he was left, in a manner, without a Friend that he could confide in; he reſolved upon ſome pretence or other to ſtrip his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not only of the Viceroyſhip of <hi>Gojam,</hi> but of all the Poſts of Authority that he was poſſeſſed of, judging it to be neceſſary to his ſafety, to keep him as low as it was poſſible; and eſpecially if the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Succors ſhould come, which had been deſired. <hi>Raz Cella,</hi> who was a Prince of a violent and raſh Temper, having diſcovered his Brother's jealouſies of him, together with the reſolutions they had
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:57883:179"/>made him take, did ſtorm at ſuch rate in all Companies, as to make the Emperor much more jealous than ever; who though reſolved to throw him down, yet being willing to do it as gently as might be, he called him out of <hi>Gojam</hi> to Command an Army he was ſending againſt one <hi>Cabrael,</hi> who had raiſed a <hi>Croiſade</hi> againſt him.</p>

Your Lordſhip's Letter when I received it, threw me into ſuch an Extaſy of joy, as that the Souls of the Fathers, when they were expecting the Advent of our Saviour, were thrown into, when that Ray of Divinity appeared to them, in ſo much that I may ſafely ſay, that from my Childhood to this day, I never felt any exultation in my heart equal to that, not being able in the ballance of my heart to weigh the gold of the joy I derived from your Lordſhip's Letter, which was purified by a ſtrong flame of love, on the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival

            </p>
            <p>On the 21ſt. of <hi>June</hi> the Patriarch arrived at <hi>Fremona,</hi> having one morning by the way ſeen a Prodigious Star in the Heavens: Some of the Fathers were of opinion, that it was the <hi>Star which Conducted the Wiſemen to</hi> Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem; but the Patriarch deſented from them,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:57883:181"/>and demonſtrated it to be the <hi>Figure of the Bleſſed Virgin</hi> Mary, who being <hi>the Star both of the Morning and the Sea, appeared to them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe them her light;</hi> which being agreed to by all, the <hi>Hymn, Ave Maria Maris Stella,</hi> &amp;c. and the <hi>Antiphona, Sub tuum praeſidium,</hi> were ſung to it.</p>
            <p>The Patriarch continued at <hi>Fremona</hi> till <hi>November;</hi> the Emperor having ſent him word, that ſo ſoon as he had made an end of chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſome Jews that were in Arms againſt him in the Mountains of <hi>Cemen,</hi> he ſhould have orders to come to Court; but <hi>Raz Cella,</hi> who would always out-do his Brother in civility to the <hi>Roman</hi>-Catholicks, with his Preſent and Complement, ſent the Patriarch a ſtrong Guard, to wait upon him whereever he went.

Not many days after, he received an Invitation from the Emperor to come to <hi>Dancez,</hi> where the Court was at that time; and being come within half a League of the Royal Camp, he was met by moſt of the Officers of the Court in their beſt Cloaths, and a body of Sixteen Thouſand Soldiers; who after having made him a profound reverence, opened to the Right and Left to make a Lane for him. Among the Grandees that went out to meet him, were <hi>Baſilides,</hi> the Emperor's Eldeſt Son, and his ſure Friend <hi>Raz Cella Chriſtos.</hi>

            <pb n="338" facs="tcp:57883:182"/>
            <p>In this State the Patriarch was Conducted to a Tent that was prepared for him without the Camp;

            <q>
               <hi>There are four principal Chairs in the World which are as the four Rivers that flow out of Paradiſe; or as the four univerſal Winds, or as the four Elements; but above all the Chair of St.</hi> Peter <hi>has the Dignity and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy; and in the ſecond place that of St.</hi> Mark <hi>of</hi> Alexandria; <hi>in the third place that of St.</hi> John; <hi>in the fourth that of</hi> Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och, <hi>which was alſo St.</hi> Peter<hi>'s, from which four all the other Biſhops are deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>Now this Canon, beſides that it is not a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> which in its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution relating to the Hierarchy, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts it in making <hi>Antioch</hi> and not <hi>Epheſus</hi> the third Chair, and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the fourth; it overthrows that very Supremacy to which the <hi>Habaſſins</hi> were about to ſwear obedience, in giving no other Primacy to the <hi>Roman,</hi> over the other three Patriarchs than it do's to the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> over the other two, which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly a Primacy only of Order and not of Juriſdiction; for had the Primacy that is here given to theſe Chairs, been given out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Apoſtles who were their firſt Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, then <hi>Antioch</hi> muſt have been the ſecond if not the firſt, and <hi>Alexandria</hi> the laſt; but notwithſtanding it is not eaſy to imagine,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:57883:183"/>that the patriarch ſhould be ignorant of theſe <hi>two great flaws</hi> in his <hi>Canon,</hi> he concluded it with this <hi>flouriſh, See now to whom you ought to give moſt Credit, to a groſs Falſary or Cheat, or to a Decree of Three hundred and eighteen Catholick Fathers.</hi>

            <p>There was another thing he much <hi>inſiſted upon,</hi> which was, That there had been Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Biſhops in all the <hi>other Chairs,</hi> whereas no <hi>Biſhop</hi> that had ſate in the <hi>Chair of</hi> Rome, had ever been ſo much as <hi>ſuſpected of any He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy;</hi> which to ſay no worſe of it, <hi>was a bold word,</hi> conſidering <hi>That</hi> Liberius <hi>ſtands accuſed by all his Contemporaries of</hi> Arianiſm; <hi>and</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius, <hi>Biſhop of the ſame See, was condemned by Name in Two General Councils, as a Heretick. But the</hi> Habaſſins <hi>having little or no Knowledge in Church-Hiſtory, encouraged the Patriarch to make ſo bold with them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Patriarch had ended his Sermon, the Emperor Commanded the Viceroy of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> who was Lord High Chamberlain, to ſpeak in his Name.</p>
            <p>There is but one thing remarkable in the Chamberlain's Speech, that is, his ſaying,
<note place="margin">The High Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain's Speech.</note> 
               <hi>That the People of</hi> Ethiopia <hi>did compel the Emperor much againſt his will, to take the Crown upon him, and that if they would have let him alone, he would have been much better contented to have lived and died in the Monaſtery they found him in, than to have been made an Emperor.</hi> Now this is very different from the Hiſtory we have of him, which makes him, during <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Za Danguil</hi>'s Reign, to have ſcoured about with
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:57883:184"/>a Body of <hi>Raperees,</hi> and to have fought his way to the Throne.</p>
            <p>When the Chamberlain had done ſpeaking, the Emperor turned about to the Patriarch, and told him, <hi>Your Lordſhip is not to think that what I am about to do now is a new thing, I having ſome years ago yeilded Obedience to the Pope, in the hands of the Father Superior, who is here preſent;</hi> nevertheleſs being willing to do it again with more Solemnity, he took the Book of the Goſpels in his hand, and Kneeling down before the Patriarch, made his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion in the form following:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>WE</hi> Seltem Saged,
<note place="margin">The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's Submiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> 
               <hi>Emperor of</hi> Ethiopia, <hi>Do Believe and Confeſs, That St.</hi> Peter <hi>was Conſtituted Prince of the Apoſtles by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as alſo Head of the whole Chriſtian Church, Chriſt having given him a Principality and Dominion over the whole World, when he ſaid unto him,</hi> Thou art Peter; <hi>and when at another time he Commanded him to feed his Sheep. We do alſo Believe and Confeſs, That the Pope of</hi> Rome, <hi>being lawfully Elected, is the true Succeſſor of the Apostle St.</hi> Peter <hi>in that Government, having the ſame Power, Dignity, and Primacy over the whole Chriſtian Church. And to the Holy Father</hi> Urban <hi>the</hi> VIIIth. <hi>who is, by the Grace of God, Pope at this time, and our Lord; and to his Succeſſors in the Government of the Church, We do Promiſe, Offer, and Swear, true Obedience and Subjection, with all humility at his Feet, for our own Perſon and Empire.</hi> So help us God, and this Holy Goſpel.</p>
            <pb n="343" facs="tcp:57883:184"/>
            <p>Upon this Submiſſion the Emperor was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented here in <hi>Europe,</hi> by the Miſſionaries as one of the greateſt Saints that had ever wore, a Crown: But upon his returning to re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Faith again, which he did, not many years after, we have this <hi>great Character recanted,</hi> being repreſented on that occaſion, and that by the ſame Miſſionaries, <hi>as a wretch that had never any thing in him that was good. So that Princes are Saints or Devils with ſome people, as they are Friends or Foes to the Pope, of which Queen</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>and</hi> Mary <hi>Queen of</hi> Scots, <hi>are a home inſtance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the Emperor, the Princes, Viceroys,
<note place="margin">The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the Prince, Grandees, and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks.</note> and Eccleſiaſticks of the Court made their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, ſaying, <hi>I. N. do Promiſe, Offer, and Swear the ſame. So help me God, and theſe Holy Goſpels.</hi> When the Solemnity of Swearing was ended, <hi>Raz Cella Chriſtos</hi> began an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue, and having talked himſelf into an heat, <hi>he drew his Sword,</hi> and holding it <hi>up na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,</hi> ſaid, <hi>what is now is now, and what is paſt is paſt, but whoſoever ſhall not do his duty here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, this,</hi> ſhaking his Sword, <hi>ſhall be his Judge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, all that were preſent took an <hi>Oath to Prince</hi> Baſilides, <hi>as Heir and Succeſſor to his Father;</hi> which Oath, ſay the Jeſuits, when the Great <hi>Raz Cella Chriſtos</hi> came to take, he, <hi>like a true Son</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, took it <hi>with a Condition,</hi> worthy of his Courage and Chriſtianity, ſaying, <hi>I Swear to the Prince as Heir to his Father in the Empire, and I do promiſe to Obey him as a Loyal Subject, ſo long as he ſhall Hold, Defend, and Favour, the Holy Catholick
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:57883:185"/>Faith, which whenſoever he ſhall ceaſe to do, I will be both his firſt and greateſt Enemy:</hi> All his Officers and Servants taking the Oath to the Prince with the ſame Condition.</p>
            <p>The Solemnity was concluded with an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication</hi> pronounced by the Patriarch, aginſt thoſe who ſhould at any time violate theſe Oaths; and with two Proclamations, <hi>the one prohibiting all</hi> Habaſſin <hi>Prieſts to perform any Eccleſiaſtical Office before they had preſented themſelves to the Patriarch;</hi> and the other <hi>Commanding all the Subjects of the Empire, upon pain of Death, to embrace Popery, and to diſcover all ſuch as adhered to their Ancient Religion, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them likewiſe to obſerve</hi> Lent <hi>and</hi> Eaſter <hi>according to the</hi> Roman <hi>Stile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next thing to be done,
<note place="margin">A new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue is ſetled on the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch.</note> was to ſettle a Revenue on the Patriarch, ſuitable to the heighth of his Dignity, to which the Lands and Perquiſites of the former <hi>Abuna</hi>'s were not reckoned to be ſufficient; the Emperor therefore beſtowed a great Eſtate in Land, lying upon the ſhoar of the <hi>Lake of Dembea,</hi> upon him, giving him alſo the Palace of the Empreſs <hi>Mariam Eima,</hi> and ordering another Palace to be Built for him in <hi>Dancaz,</hi> where the Court reſided for the moſt part.</p>
            <p>The Patriarch having thus feather'd his own Neſt, begun to look abroad, and having got the Emperor to found a College for Sixty Students at <hi>Dancaz,</hi> he begun to ſend his Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionaries about, and not having Fathers enough for ſo great an harveſt, he was forc'd to make uſe of ſuch <hi>Habaſſins</hi> as were obſerved to have the moſt Zeal for the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
            <pb n="345" facs="tcp:57883:185"/>
            <p>And as it is common with ſome People to reckon a work done before it is well begun,
<note place="margin">The Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits do reckon their work done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun.</note> ſo when the News of this ſolemn ſubmiſſion came to <hi>Lisbon, Ethiopia</hi> was reckoned to be the Pope's, as ſure as <hi>Portugal;</hi> for in a Book Printed there in the year 1623. by one <hi>Vega</hi> a Jeſuit, the World was told, <hi>That the fervour wherewith the</hi> Habaſſins <hi>crowded into the boſom of Mother Church, was too great to be either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed or conceived, and that there was nothing to be heard all over that vaſt Empire, but Praiſes of the</hi> Roman <hi>Faith; Old and Young, Rich and Poor, declaring that there was nothing to be compared to it; and that whereas hitherto they had been as blind as Bats, and miſerably impoſed upon, they do now behold the Light, and are happily reſcued from the Blindneſs and Cheats of falſe Teachers, the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>being the only Faith that deſerved to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; and if there ſhould be occaſion, that is worth the dying for.</hi> Nay, the Patriarch him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as appears from a Letter of his ſent to <hi>Portugal</hi> about this time, was pretty ſanguine too, having aſſured the Fathers of his Society, <hi>That he ſpoke within compaſs when he ſaid, an Hundred thouſand had been Converted within a Year to the</hi> Roman <hi>Church;</hi> which, conſidering that <hi>Ethiopia</hi> is no very populous Countrey, was an extraordinary Harveſt. And I do well remember, that in the year 1685. he would have been looked upon at <hi>Lisbon</hi> as one of the greateſt lyars in the World, that ſhould have denied that in Eight Months time above Six hundred thouſand Proteſtants had been Chriſtened, for that was the word, in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="346" facs="tcp:57883:186"/>
            <p>There were likewiſe a great many pretty ſtories,
<note place="margin">Pretty ſtories ſent from <hi>Habaſſia.</hi>
               </note> either ſent from <hi>Ethiopia</hi> or made at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> upon this occaſion; I ſhall only ſet down one of them, by which the Reader may judge of the reſt.</p>
            <p>The Emperor having one day commanded one of his Sons, who was but a Child, to take up the Cudgels for the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, againſt one of the moſt Learned of the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſin</hi> Monks, <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> for ſo the Emperor uſed to call that Child, took the Monk to task preſently, asking him, without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditation, <hi>Whether he Believed Chriſt to have been God before he was Born?</hi> The Monk made anſwer, <hi>be did: Bellarmine</hi> then asked him, <hi>Whether he did not believe God's Nature to be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from Man's Nature?</hi> The Monk an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>It was undoubtedly: Hold your hand then,</hi> ſaid <hi>Bellarmine, ſince you acknowledge he was God that took Man's Nature upon him, How can you deny that there muſt be Two Natures in Chriſt;</hi> with which argument the poor Monk <hi>was ſtruck as mute as a Fiſh.</hi> It is no great matter whether this ſtory was true or not, it being enough that it was pat for a Sermon upon the Text, <hi>Out of the mouths of babes and ſucklings,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But as all other Orders, as we have hinted before, do accuſe the Jeſuit Miſſionaries of magnifying their own Labours and Succeſſes thus, beyond all the bounds of Credibility, ſo they do complain likewiſe of their diſparaging the Labours of all other Friars in their remote Miſſions.</p>
            <p>Of which Proud and envious carriage, the Jeſuits reſident at <hi>Agra</hi> do, in their Letters of this
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:57883:186"/>Year to their Superiors at <hi>Goa,</hi> furniſh us with a notable inſtance; where, ſpeaking of ſome Friars, who, I ſuppoſe were <hi>Carmelites,</hi> being come newly to that City, they ſay, <hi>They were ſo high-flown, as to pretend to nothing under Raiſing the Dead;</hi> adding, <hi>they have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to work, but we do not as yet hear, that they have Raiſed any that were Dead to Life: We pray God they may prove true Prophets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But though the <hi>Roman</hi> Church was thus Triumphant at Court, the whole Body of the Empire, notwithſtanding the late bloody Proclamation, was extreamly prejudiced againſt it, and the whole Court, for its ſake, ſo that the Patriarch's Miſſionaries, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they went, met with but bad entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Two of them going into a Church in <hi>Tigre</hi> to ſay Maſs, were Commanded, by a Perſon of Honour that lived in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, <hi>to go and ſay their Maſſes ſomewhere elſe, and not in the Church where his Father, who had lived and died in the</hi> Alexandrian <hi>Faith, lay buried;</hi> but the Miſſionaries knowing they had the Government on their ſide, made anſwer, <hi>That he muſt not think to terrifie them out of their Duties, for Maſs they came to ſay there, and Maſs they would ſay.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Two <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſin</hi> Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionaries are Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered for ſaying the <hi>Roman</hi> Maſs.</note> The Gentleman finding they were not to be hindered by Threats, offered them Money to forbear; and when he found that would not do neither, he threw himſelf <hi>down upon his Father's grave,</hi> crying in a <hi>mighty Paſſion, that he would be buried with his Father, rather than ſuffer a thing to be done there, which he knew muſt be offenſive to his Ghoſt.</hi>
               <pb n="348" facs="tcp:57883:187"/>But the Miſſionaries taking no notice of his words, performed their Maſſes, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the Gentleman to that degree, that he had them both Murthered next Night in their Beds.</p>
            <p>The Emperor and the Court kept the Holy Week and <hi>Eaſter</hi> with the Patriarch at the Church of <hi>Geneta Jeſus,</hi> where <hi>Raz Cella,</hi> the Heroe of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> Hiſtories, with his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, guarded the Sepulcher all <hi>Good-Friday</hi> at night; and in the proceſſion there were ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>that whipt themſelves,</hi> after the faſhion of <hi>Portugal,</hi> which was a ſtrange ſight in <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Patriarch having publiſhed the Six firſt General Councils with a Catechiſm in the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſin</hi> Tongue, begun a Viſitation; but finding himſelf not able to endure the fatigue thereof, he cut it ſhort, leaving it to the new Biſhop, who was expected daily from the <hi>Indies.</hi> The Emperor upon his having been told that the Patriarch had demanded no Fees of the Clergy at his Viſitation, is ſaid to have reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the former <hi>Abuna</hi>'s; who not having ſo great an Eſtate, as he had beſtowed upon the Patriarch, did uſe to take ſome; ſaying of them, <hi>That they ſeemed to have held Viſitations for no other end but to get Money, the thing in the World the</hi> Roman <hi>Prelates and</hi> Jeſuits <hi>hate the moſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Year 1627, the <hi>Gauls</hi> made a great Incurſion into <hi>Ethiopia;</hi> and having ſurprized the Viceroy <hi>Buco,</hi> who was a great Stickler for Popery, they put him and his whole Army to the Sword, but they were afterwards drive
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:57883:187"/>home by <hi>Raz Cella,</hi> who do's all the great things in the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> Hiſtories.</p>
            <p>But the ill ſucceſs of <hi>Julius, Joanel,</hi> and others who had taken up Arms in defence of their Religion, had not ſo far cowed the Zeal of the <hi>Habaſſins,</hi> as to make them ſubmit quietly to the Eſtabliſhment of Popery; and the diſcontented Grandees, which are what no Government ever wanted, knowing the people to be extreamly angry with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and the Court, are ſaid to have made uſe of their Religious reſentments for the carrying on of their own private deſigns.</p>
            <p>And accordingly <hi>Tecla Guergis,</hi> the Viceroy of <hi>Tigre,</hi> who was Married to a Daughter of the Emperor's, Publiſhed a Proclamation on the Fifth of <hi>November;</hi> wherein having decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelf <hi>of the</hi> Alexandrian <hi>Faith, and ſwore to Defend it with the laſt drop of his Blood againſt all the world;</hi>
               <note place="margin">A fifth <hi>Croiſade</hi> raiſed againſt the Emperor.</note> He ordered all that were of the ſame faith to bring in all the Crucifixes and Reliques which had been forced upon them by the Fathers; and having got great numbers of them into his hands, he <hi>made a Bonfire</hi> of them all, telling the Monks and Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, who were rejoicing at the ſight, <hi>That they might ſee by this that he was in earneſt;</hi> and not contented with having given them this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of his having abſolutely broke with his Father-in-Law and the <hi>Jeſuits;</hi> He Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered his own Chaplain in the ſight of the Camp, becauſe he refuſed to return to the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Faith, giving his body afterwards to the Officers of his Army, who with their Cimiters cut it in a thouſand pieces.</p>
            <pb n="350" facs="tcp:57883:188"/>
            <p>When the Emperor heard of this new <hi>Croiſade,</hi> he ſent <hi>Kebo Chriſtus</hi> with an Army to ſuppreſs it in the beginning; who having Marched day and night, was up with <hi>Guergis</hi> ſooner than he expected;

            <p>When the Officers came to the priſon, they found him hanging; and perceiving that he was not quite dead, they cut him down; and carrying him to that Tree, hanged him upon it. The Emperor carried all the Court-Ladies to entertain them with this ſad ſpectacle; and having commanded them to look on the Dead body, he told them, <hi>That from that day for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, they would do well to look to themſelves and if they either rejected or forſook the</hi> Roman <hi>Faith; not to expect a pardon for it, ſince he had denied one to his own Son-in-Law for having done it;</hi> and to terrify the tender <hi>Sex the more,</hi> about fifteen days after, he commanded <hi>Adivato,</hi> a Lady of great Quality, to be hanged before them upon the ſame Tree; for whoſe pardon, when the Empreſs and all the Ladies of the Court had thrown themſelves at his feet, he ſhaked them off, ſaith Father <hi>Anthony,</hi> with the following <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Fable.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <hi>There was upon a time a very ancient man,
<note place="margin">A Lady is put to death for her Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> who being told that a Child was dead, made anſwer, Children are tender Creatures, and a ſmall matter carries them off; and being told afterwards there was a Young man dead, he ſaid, Conſidering the raſhneſs of Youth, that was no wonder; but when be was told that an Old man was dead, he wrung his hands, and cried as if the world had been at an
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:57883:189"/>end, imagining death ſtood ready to arreſt him; So, ſaith the Emperor, you could ſee</hi> Guergis <hi>and his Companions ſuffer without ſpeaking a word in their behalf, but now one of your own Sex is to ſuffer, you are all in an uproar to ſave her; but I will have you all know, That this Shoeſtring of</hi> Aba Jacob<hi>'s, whom</hi> Guergis <hi>had Murthered for being a</hi> Roman <hi>Prieſt, is ſtrong enough to hang this Sow, and all ſuch as ſhe is.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>Father <hi>Anthony,</hi> who was preſent at all theſe Executions, has in his Relation of them, made ſo true a remark upon the change Popery had wrought on the Emperor's temper,

<note place="margin">The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates a great Man for keeping Church-Lands.</note> ordered <hi>an Excommunication to be pronounced againſt him;</hi> the Nobleman ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving never dreamt of any ſuch Thunderclap, is ſaid to have been ſo aſtoniſhed by its Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Maledictions, That he <hi>fell upon the ground, as if</hi> Datham <hi>and</hi> Abiram, <hi>to whom the Excommunication had delivered him, had been coming upon him like two furies to carry him quick
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:57883:190"/>down into Hell;</hi> but being come to himſelf again, he beſeeched the Emperor and the whole Congregation to intercede with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch in his behalf, promiſing <hi>to reſtore the Lands to the Church immediately;</hi> which being done, the Patriarch <hi>abſolved him in</hi> forma Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae, <hi>ſtriking him with a road all the time the</hi> Miſerere <hi>was Singing.</hi> At which <hi>exerciſe of Diſcipline,</hi> though all the true Romaniſts, ſay the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> rejoiced, <hi>they that were Hereticks in their hearts were mad to ſee themſelves ſubjected to ſuch reproachful puniſhments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Year the Foundation of the Patriari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Church was laid at <hi>Dancez;</hi> the Emperor himſelf having laid the firſt ſtone, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to build it at his own proper coſt; and as an Earneſt of his <hi>Devotion for our Lady,</hi> to whom it was Dedicated, he took a Crown of pure Gold off his Head and gave it to be employ'd in gilding the Seats in our Lady's Chappel; it was to have been a large Church with three Naves, but <hi>Popery did not ſtay long enough in</hi> Ethiopia <hi>to ſee it finiſhed:</hi> For at the ſame time that its foundations were laid, the Emperor's jealouſies of his Brother revived again; one <hi>Melcha Chriſtos,</hi> who was his firſt Couſin having aſſured both the Emperor and the Prince,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Raz Cella</hi> is accuſed of plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſes</hi> to make himſelf Emperor.</note> that <hi>Raz Cella</hi> was continually plotting with the Patriarch and the Fathers, to bring a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Army into <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> to make himſelf Emperor; in which charge <hi>Melcha Chriſtos</hi> was ſeconded by one <hi>Leſſana Christos,</hi> who being an Officer of the Army, was ſecured by <hi>Raz Cella,</hi> ſo ſoon as he heard of his being one of his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:57883:190"/>and condemned by him to be put to death immediately as an Apoſtate to the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Faith. <hi>Leſſana,</hi> to prevent the Execution of this Sentence, appealed to the Emperor; and fearing leſt he might be diſpatched out of the way, before he could have an anſwer from Court, he broke priſon; but being taken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could get to the Emperor, he had his head chopped off, not for Hereſy, nor for having accuſed his General, but for having broke Jayl. <hi>But</hi> Raz Cella <hi>by ſtopping of</hi> Leſſana'<hi>s mouth thus, did open a Thouſand against him; and did Confirm the Emperor and the Prince in their former jealouſies;</hi> it being in every body's mouth,
<note place="margin">One of the chief Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes againſt him is murthered by his order.</note> 
               <hi>that</hi> Raz Cella <hi>had murther'd</hi> Leſſana <hi>for no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but becauſe he was privy to his plotting ſecretly with the Patriarch, and was ready to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it upon him if he had been ſuffered to go to Court.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The diſcovery of this plot gave a <hi>fatal blow to Popery in</hi> Ethiopia; every body, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Prince, being ſatisfied, that conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how <hi>odious</hi> Raz Cella <hi>had rendered himſelf to the</hi> Habaſſins, it could be nothing but his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received ſome aſſurances of a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Army, that could have put <hi>ſuch fumes</hi> into his head; ſo that after this the Prince never gave over perſecuting the Patriarch and Fathers until he had rid <hi>Ethiopia</hi> of them, as we ſhall ſee hereafter.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1629, the <hi>Agau</hi>'s of <hi>Begameder</hi> took up Arms for their Religion; and having Maſſacred the Soldiers that were Quartered upon them, and drive their Viceroy <hi>Za Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam</hi>
               <pb n="356" facs="tcp:57883:191"/>out of the Province,
<note place="margin">The <hi>Agus</hi> take up Arms in Defence of their Religion.</note> they ſent Envoys to a Prince of the Royal Family, who had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſanctuary among the <hi>Gauls,</hi> to come and take the Crown of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> which belonged to him of right, upon him; promiſing <hi>to ſtand by him in Defence of their Religion, with their Lives and Fortunes.</hi> This Prince was probably Son either to the late Emperor <hi>Jacob,</hi> or to <hi>Za Danguil,</hi> who are both ſaid to have had Sons; though we hear nothing of them after their Fathers were ſlain, unleſs we will believe <hi>Zaga Chriſti,</hi> who died at <hi>Ruel</hi> near <hi>Paris</hi> in the Year 1629, to have been the Son of <hi>Jacob,</hi> as he pretended; and who reported there, that it was with the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> that <hi>Suſeneus</hi> had Conquered and Murthered his Father, on the account of his being an Enemy to the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith.</p>
            <p>But whoſeſoever Son this Prince was whom the <hi>Agau</hi>'s had invited to take the Crown upon him, he came to them with the Envoys they had ſent to him; and having accepted of the Crown, did ſwear to defend the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Faith againſt all the world: Upon which the Monks, who were enraged almoſt to madneſs, by the Emperor's having commanded all his Subjects of what Degree or Quality ſoever, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely <hi>to turn</hi> Roman-<hi>Catholicks,</hi> flocked to their <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Emperor from all Parts, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring againſt the Emperor, as <hi>another</hi> Julian <hi>the Apoſtate;</hi> and <hi>who was not content with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving abandoned the Religion of his Fathers himſelf, but he would force all the People of</hi> Ethiopia <hi>to follow his Example.</hi> By which tragical Exclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they raiſed the Countrey whereever they
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:57883:191"/>came, chiefly the <hi>Peaſants of Laſta,</hi> who have the reputation of being the ſtouteſt Men in the whole Empire. But the Emperor having got together an Army of Twenty five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot, and Two thouſand Horſe, March<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards the Peaſants by the way of <hi>Gojam,</hi> in the beginning of <hi>February,</hi> and having at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked the ſtrong Mountain of <hi>Laſta</hi> on all ſides, he was beat back, having beſides his General and ſeveral Perſons of the firſt Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Seven hundred Soldiers ſlain in the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Peaſants fluſhed with this Succeſs, followed their blow ſo cloſe, that they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged the Emperor to Retreat; and had not <hi>Kebo Chriſtos</hi> come in to him very ſeaſonably with a Body of old Troops, it was thought the Peaſants would have gone near to have hemmed him in among the Mountains, which if they had done, they would have had him and his whole Army at their mercy.</p>
            <p>The Emperor,
<note place="margin">The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror is obliged to employ his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</note> though very unwilling to have employed his Brother any more, was forced by the condition of his Affairs to do it, not having a Man, beſides him, that knew how to Command an Army; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he ſent to him, to come and take that Command upon him; <hi>Raz Cella,</hi> who ſince his Diſgrace had retired into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of the <hi>Agau</hi>'s, having received this Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage from the Emperor, yeilded Obedience to it; and having, after he had got into <hi>Gojam,</hi> placed Guards in all the Paſſages the <hi>Agau</hi>'s had into that Province, he repaired to Court, where he was received with great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of Reſpect and Affection.</p>
            <pb n="358" facs="tcp:57883:192"/>
            <p>But the News, which came a few days after, of the <hi>Agau</hi>'s being got into the heart of <hi>Gojam,</hi> which they were plundering at a moſt unmerciful rate, the Soldiers that had been left by <hi>Raz Cella</hi> to Guard the Paſſages, having all either run home, or gone over to the <hi>Agau</hi>'s ſo ſoon as they approached them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived Peoples former jealouſies of <hi>Raz Cella,</hi> it being in every bodies mouth,
<note place="margin">He is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of treachery.</note> 
               <hi>That he was in a Correſpondence with the</hi> Agau<hi>'s, and had placed ſuch Men in the Paſſes, as he knew certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would go over to them, or that at leaſt would not oppoſe them.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Raz Cella</hi> that he might clear himſelf of theſe ſuſpicions, Marched with all the ſpeed he could towards the <hi>Agau</hi>'s; who having advice of his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing towards them, withdrew, returning home full of the Spoils of that rich Countrey; which the <hi>Alexandrians</hi> ſaid conſidently, <hi>Raz Cella</hi> might have prevented if he had had a mind to it. But notwithſtanding all theſe ſurmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and that his having thus obliged the <hi>Agau</hi>'s to leave <hi>Gojam,</hi> was no argument at all of his having had no hand in letting them into it; the Emperor was, it ſeems, ſo well ſatisfied with his Conduct, that he gave him the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>royſhip of that Kingdom again, giving the Chief Command of the Army to the Prince,
<note place="margin">The Prince a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandons the <hi>Roman,</hi> and goes intirely into the <hi>Alexandri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> intereſt.</note> who was now become a mortal Enemy to the Patriarch and the Fathers.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Alexandrians</hi> having thus got the Prince intirely in their Intereſt, begun to contrive how to rid the Court of all that were Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions for Popery in it; and having perſuaded the Emperor to ſend his Brother into <hi>Gojam,</hi>
               <pb n="359" facs="tcp:57883:192"/>they got him likewiſe to ſend <hi>Kebo Chriſtos,</hi> who was the ſecond great ſtickler for Popery, into <hi>Tigre,</hi> whereof he was Viceroy, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his preſence there was neceſſary, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of its neighbourhood to the Peaſants that were in Arms.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Kebo,</hi> though he was ſenſible upon what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign he was Commanded to his Government, yet not being in a condition to refuſe,
<note place="margin">The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts</hi> loſe ground at Court daily.</note> he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be very willing to leave the Court, giving this for his reaſon, <hi>That he was not able to bear the coldneſs that increaſed in it daily for Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> declaring, <hi>That he had much rather be ſlain by the Peaſants of</hi> Laſta, <hi>Fighting for the Faith, than continue Chamberlain to the Emperor, and be obliged to Perſecute thoſe Good Men who had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed him therein, which he ſaw plainly the Court would be brought to do in a ſhort time.</hi> Thus <hi>Kebo</hi> full of fears and diſcontents left the Court, and being arrived at <hi>Tigre,</hi> went immediately to <hi>Fremona,</hi> where having ſpent ſome days with the Fathers, <hi>only about Ghoſtly buſineſs,</hi> he advanced from thence with a ſmall Body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdom of <hi>Amahara,</hi> where the Prince had promiſed to joyn him with the Army; but <hi>Kebo</hi> having been ſent thither by the <hi>Alexandrians</hi> on purpoſe to be Sacrificed,
<note place="margin">Their great Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Kebo</hi> is ſent into <hi>Tigre</hi> to be Sacrificed.</note> no Prince came near him; and having wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for him till his Proviſions were all ſpent, the Peaſants, as he was retreating to <hi>Tigre,</hi> fell upon his Rear, and having Slain him, as he was Fighting Manfully to have made good his Retreat, his Soldiers, who were all in their hearts <hi>Alexandrians,</hi> ſo ſoon as they
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:57883:193"/>ſaw their General fall, went over to the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants as to the Defenders of their Faith.</p>
            <p>The Patriarch, who performed a ſolemn Office for <hi>Kebo</hi>'s Soul, was wonderfully affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted for the loſs of ſuch a Champion; and as <hi>Misfortunes do ſeldom come ſingle,</hi> his tears were not well dried up for this loſs, before he received the bad News of <hi>Tecur Egzi,</hi> the Grandee that was to have gone Ambaſſador to <hi>Portugal,</hi> being killed by the <hi>Galls</hi> in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rode they had made into the Kingdom of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the fall of theſe Two Pillars of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, the <hi>Alexandrians</hi> about the Court grew bolder every day, and having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the Emperor to be Melancholy upon ſuch a run of Loſſes, they all waited upon him in a Body, one of them, in the Name of all the reſt, asking him:</p>
            <p>
               <q>Sir, We deſire to know how long we are to worry one another thus? The poor Peaſants that are in Arms have no Quarrel with your Highneſs, but only for forcing them to be of the<hi> Roman </hi>Religion: That Religion may, perhaps, be true, but it is what they do not underſtand, neither will they trouble themſelves, being well ſatisfied with their Old Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to ſtudy a New one; and ſo being reſolved never to be of any other Faith but that of their Forefathers, they have ſet up an Emperor, who has promiſed to defend them in the Profeſſion of it, calling us<hi> Turks </hi>and<hi> Moors </hi>for having not only embraced a New Religion our ſelves, but for Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting of them becauſe they will not do it.</q> The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror tho he returned them no anſwer to theſe
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:57883:193"/>paſſionate Remonſtrances, encouraged them by his ſilence and attention to what they ſaid, to ply him daily upon that point; deſiring him, at leaſt, to leave his Subjects <hi>to their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of being of which of the Two Religions they liked beſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as when things are <hi>tumbling,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch haſtens the down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery by two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet acts.</note> every <hi>ſmall puſh haſtens their fall;</hi> ſo there were <hi>Two Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of the Patriarch's which gave Popery a terrible ſhake, in the tottering condition it was in at Court.</p>
            <p>The firſt was, His having commanded the Corps of an Eminent Monk, who had been for ſeveral years General <hi>of the whole Order of</hi> Tecla Haymonot, to be taken out of the Grave, where it lay Buried in a Church, and to be thrown into the open Fields, for his having declared at his Death, <hi>That he died in the</hi> Alexandrian, <hi>and not in the</hi> Roman <hi>Faith.</hi> It is not to be imagined, ſay the Jeſuits, how great a ſtorm this act of Diſcipline put the whole Empire into; it being in every Body's mouth, <hi>That the</hi> Romaniſts <hi>were not ſatisfied with Perſecuting People while they were alive, who would not turn to their Religion, but did Perſecute them beyond the Grave; which puts a ſtop to the Rage of all other Nations and Sects of People, by Commanding their Bodies, contrary to the Laws of Humanity, to be taken out of the Earth, and thrown for a Prey to Birds and Wild Beaſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond was, the Patriarch having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a Woman to Priſon <hi>for being a Witch,</hi> and, notwithſtanding upon his having been informed that there was a Law in <hi>Ethiopia</hi> which prohibited People <hi>to believe that there is
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:57883:194"/>any ſuch thing as Witches;</hi> the belief whereof, they ſay, is founded upon the Error of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees, That there are Two Independent Gods, a Good one, and a Bad one;</hi> he commanded her preſently to be ſet at Liberty; yet that was not ſufficient to ſtop the Clamour, or to keep the <hi>Alexandrians</hi> from accuſing the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> of being <hi>Manichees, and who in defiance to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Laws of the Empire, were endeavouring to bring the belief of Two Eternal and Independent Principles in among them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was another thing happened at this time too, which, though in it ſelf ridiculous, made a great noiſe, and did Popery ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervice.</p>
            <p>A Man, who appeared to be Diſtracted, running into the great Hall of the Palace, cried out, <hi>He had a Meſſage from Heaven to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver to the Emperor;</hi> the <hi>Alexandrians,</hi> who were believed to have made the <hi>Farce,</hi> having perſuaded the Emperor to hear what he had to ſay, he told his Highneſs, <hi>That it was now Three days ſince he was Raiſed from the Dead, and having ſince been carried up to Paradiſe, was ſent by God to deliver the following Meſſage to him:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Hear, O Emperor, I have bore with you for ſome Years, expecting that you would have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of the great Sin you have been guilty of, in forſaking the Religion of your Forefathers; during all which time the Bleſſed Virgin has been on her Knees before her Son to Intercede for you; but I am now to tell you, That in caſe you do not Repent of that Sin, that God will Puniſh you with a ſtrange
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:57883:194"/>Judgment.</q> But notwithſtanding, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror Commanded the Fellow to be ſoundly Whipp'd for his News, the <hi>Alexandrians</hi> made great uſe of what he had ſaid, it being reported over the whole Empire, <hi>That an Angel from Heaven had appeared to the Emperor with a Command to him from God to return to his Old Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi> But among other things, the Emperor is ſaid to have been diſpleaſed with himſelf for having in the <hi>firſt heats of his new Religion ſettled ſo much Land on the Patriarch,</hi> which he would gladly have had a pretence to have <hi>reſumed</hi> again, to ſettle it upon his Younger Sons; but whatever were the cauſe of the Emperor growing every day leſs fond of Popery, the <hi>Alexandrians</hi> being at him continually <hi>for a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration,</hi> he promiſed to ſpeak to the Patriarch about it, and accordingly having ſent for him, he told him,
<note place="margin">He oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to him by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror.</note> 
               <hi>He had done all that was in his power to have introduced the</hi> Roman <hi>Faith into his Empire, but he was now ſatisfied that it was not to be done by force, it being viſible that his People hated it more than ever, ſince he Commanded them to embrace it.</hi> Beſides, <hi>there was an abſolute neceſſity of his granting them a Toleration, ſince if he did not, he would quickly have his whole Empire againſt him; his Soldiers that he made uſe of againſt the Peaſants, being in their hearts no leſs</hi> Alexandrians <hi>than the Peaſants themſelves.</hi> The Patriarch, who was extreamly troubled to hear this from the Emperor, told him, <hi>That his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was miſerably miſled by Evil Counſellors, who under pretence of a Toleration ſought the utter Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of the</hi> Roman <hi>Faith.</hi> But the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror urging ſtill, <hi>That ſomething muſt be done to
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:57883:195"/>ſatisfy the minds of his Subjects,</hi> the Patriarch was forc'd to promiſe <hi>the Toleration of all ſuch Ancient</hi> Habaſſin <hi>Cuſtoms as were not contrary to the Faith, but upon condition that ſuch a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration ſhould not be Proclaimed;</hi> becauſe if that were done, <hi>the</hi> Habaſſins, <hi>he ſaid, would Triumph ſo upon it, as to conclude that the</hi> Roman <hi>Church was about to make Her Exit out of</hi> Ethiopia.</p>
            <p>While Popery was in this declining ſtate, <hi>Dom Apolinar D' Almeyda,</hi> the new Biſhop of <hi>Nice,</hi> arrived in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> bringing a <hi>Jubilee</hi> with him, and Letters from the Pope to the Emperor and the Prince; which Letters, though I have great reaſon to believe they were writ in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> in order to rekindle the Emperor's Zeal for Popery, which was ſlackened ſo much of late; I ſhall neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſet them down as they are publiſhed by the Jeſuits, leaving them to the cenſure of the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Reader.</p>

            <p>The new Viceroy of <hi>Gojam, Raz Cella</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been quickly turned out of that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was ſo enraged at this change in the Emperor's mind, that he was for depoſing him preſently as an irreconcileable Enemy to their Religion, and for declaring the Prince, who was a hearty Friend to it, Emperor in his
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:57883:197"/>room; and being encouraged ſo to do, by the Monks and <hi>Alexandrians</hi> that were about him,
<note place="margin">The Viceroy of <hi>Gojam</hi> thereupon proclaims the Prince Emperor.</note> he proclaimed the Prince <hi>Baſilides</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> at the head of his Army; and having done it, diſpatch'd a Courier to him to acquaint him therewith, and to deſire him to join the Army he had the command of, with his, that they might be able to ſubdue all the Enemies of their Religion; but the Prince was ſo far from being pleaſed with the Viceroy's having <hi>proclaimed him Emperor,</hi> that to ſatisfy his Father of his having <hi>had no hand in it,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Prince is diſpleaſed with the Viceroy for what he had done.</note> he ſent the Courier that had brought him the firſt news of it to him <hi>in chains,</hi> to puniſh him as he ſhould think fit. The Fathers, whoſe Church of <hi>Collela</hi> was but at a ſmall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Viceroy's Camp, were put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch a terrible fright by this Proclamation, that they immediately ſhut their Gates; and their Convent being built very ſtrong, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all their Houſes in <hi>Ethiopia</hi> were more like Caſtles than Monaſteries; they reſolved to defend themſelves until an Army ſhould come from the Emperor to relieve them.</p>
            <p>The Viceroy hearing how much the Fathers were alarm'd, and of their having taken all the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> of the Neighbourhood into their Gariſon, he ſent them word, That they had no reaſon to be ſo affrighted, for ſeeing they did not come into <hi>Ethiopia</hi> before they were ſent for, no body could blame them for having come, or for what the Emperor had done ſince their Arrival; and being extreamly deſirous to have wheedled them out of their ſtrong-hold, he bid the Meſſenger whiſper
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:57883:198"/>them in the Ear, That notwithſtanding all he had done, he was ſtill a true <hi>Roman</hi>-Catholick in his heart, having been forc'd to ſet forth he late Proclamation, to quiet the Minds of the People if it were poſſible; deſiring them likewiſe to ſend him the Horſes and Muskets that had been left in their Convent by <hi>Raz Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la:</hi> but the Fathers not believing a ſyllable of what he ſaid, refuſed to open their Gates, or to deliver their Arms to the Meſſenger; which provoked the Viceroy to that degree, that he changed his note, and ſent them word, That <hi>if they did not deliver the Arms and Horſes to him preſently, he would come for them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and that if they did give him that trouble, he would be at a little more for to teach them bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter manners than to diſobey his Commands.</hi> And he had certainly been as good as his word, had he not been hindered by the news of a great Army advancing towards him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace.</p>
            <p>The Monks, who were got in ſhoals about the Viceroy, adviſed him to do ſomething to ſatisfy the people, that he was in no Correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence with the Court, but was in earneſt to defend their Faith; adding, that there was no ſuch way of doing that, as by making Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of ſome of thoſe, who to pleaſe the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, had changed their Religion; the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy approving of their advice, commanded a Monk who was his own firſt Couſin, to be put to death publickly for having turned <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>-Catholick.</p>
            <p>The Prince, who Commanded his Father's Army, having received advice that the Viceroy
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:57883:198"/>was Marching with all the ſpeed he could to join the Peaſants of <hi>Laſta,</hi> croſſed the <hi>Nile,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He marcheth againſt him.</note> and by doing ſo, put himſelf betwixt him and them; and having brought him to an Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, had an abſolute Victory over him. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which,
<note place="margin">He routs the <hi>Croi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſade</hi> and ſends the Viceroy priſoner to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> that he might fully ſatisfy his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Viceroy's not having had the leaſt encouragement from him to proclaim him Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, he ſent him with ſeveral of his Chief Officers Priſoners to him, that if he would give himſelf the trouble, he might examine that matter to the bottom. The Emperor, who could not but take this extreamly well of the Prince, having examined the Viceroy and his Officers, commanded Seven of them to be preſently put to death, Six of which are ſaid to have died <hi>Roman</hi>-Catholicks; which the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth was ſo far from doing, that when one of the Fathers told him at the place of Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>That he would be Damned for him if he were not Damned if he died out of the Communion of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church;</hi> he bid the Father <hi>look to himſelf, that he be not Damned upon his own account, for he was reſolved to venture his Soul with the</hi> Alexandrian <hi>Faith, by dying in it.</hi> Behold a Miracle, ſay the <hi>Jeſuits;</hi> the Seven bodies being after they were Executed thrown to the Dogs, they all fell preſently upon the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and eat it up bones and all, without ſo much as offering to touch or ſmell at any of the Six <hi>Roman</hi>-Catholicks bodies that lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. One of the Viceroy's Chief Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants continuing to rail againſt Popery, and the Emperor for forcing it upon his Subjects, was hanged by the thigh upon an Iron hook
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:57883:199"/>that was driven into a Tree; and after having hung thereon for ſome time, for perſiſting in his railing, he had his Tongue cut out; the Viceroy himſelf being ſecretly put to death a few days after. The Emperor having none now to deal with but the Peaſants of <hi>Laſta,</hi> advanced towards them in perſon with a great Army; and having beat them out of three or four of their ſtrongeſt Mountains, was in hopes to have reduced them all to his obedience in a ſhort time; but the ſturdy Peaſants were ſo far from being terrified into a ſubmiſſion by thoſe ill ſucceſſes, that they fell upon the Viceroy of <hi>Begameder</hi> in his Quarters; and having made a great ſlaughter among his men,
<note place="margin">The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror is defeated by the Peaſants of <hi>Laſta.</hi>
               </note> obliged him to retreat in great diſorder. The Emperor, who was grown <hi>old and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous,</hi> apprehending the Peaſants to have been much ſtronger than they were, and fearing leſt he might be hemmed in by them among the Mountains, retired in a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation, his Rear being cloſely purſued by the Peaſants for ſome Leagues. The <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drians</hi> obſerving the Emperor's Spirits to be much dejected by the diſgrace of this Campaign, renewed their Remonſtrances to him, ſome of them asking him,
<note place="margin">He is paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately addreſſed to for a Tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> 
               <hi>Whether he thought it made a Prince look great in Hiſtory, to have been conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually fighting with his own Subjects, and eſpecially his Peaſants?</hi> Others telling him plainly, <hi>That if he did not ſpeedily grant his Subjects a Toleration, that he would be Deſerted by his whole Army, who would fight no longer againſt their Countreymen, only for defending the Religion of their Forefathers, and which they themſelves were of, no leſs than the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants.</hi>
               <pb n="373" facs="tcp:57883:199"/>The Emperor promiſed them to ſpeak to the Patriarch about it; and having accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſent for him, he told him again, <hi>That he could not but be ſenſible of his having done all that lay in his power for to have eſtabliſhed the</hi> Roman <hi>Faith in his Empire;</hi>
               <note place="margin">He ſpeaks to the Patriarch about it, and will not be deni'd.</note> 
               <hi>and that whereas he had endeavoured to force his Subjects to embrace it, he was now ſatisfied that there was no bringing them to it by that Method, it being viſible to every body that his having uſed it had had no other effect but to increaſe his peoples averſion for that Religion.</hi> He told him farther, that he had reaſon to fear, <hi>That if he did not quickly grant a Toleration, that he ſhould be Deſerted by his whole Court and Army;</hi> but not being willing to do any thing in that matter without his conſent, he had therefore ſent for him to adviſe with him about the manner of it; adding, <hi>Something muſt be done, and that ſpeedily, to quiet the minds of the people.</hi> The Patriarch, who was extreamly troubled to hear the Emperor ſpeak of a Toleration again, made anſwer, That <hi>his Highneſs was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably miſled by evil Counſellors, who under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a Toleration, deſigned the utter Extirpation of the</hi> Roman <hi>Faith;</hi> but the Emperor urging ſtill the neceſſity there was thereof, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch was forc'd to promiſe to give way <hi>to the Toleration of all ſuch</hi> Habaſſin <hi>Cuſtoms as were not contrary to the</hi> Roman <hi>Faith;</hi> but upon condition <hi>that the ſaid Toleration ſhould not be proclaimed,</hi> that ſo it might look more like <hi>a Connivence</hi> than a <hi>Toleration:</hi> Whereupon it was concerted betwixt them, that the <hi>Habaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins</hi> ſhould be Tolerated <hi>as to Three things,</hi> one was <hi>the obſervation of Saturday;</hi> the Second, <hi>the
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:57883:200"/>Faſting on</hi> Wedneſdays <hi>and not on</hi> Saturdays; and the third was, <hi>that they might uſe their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Offices according to his Emendations of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Alexandrians</hi> being acquainted by the Emperor with what the Patriarch was willing to grant them, ſeemed to accept of it very thankfully; only they told him it muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, for if that were not done, it would have no effect at all on the minds of the people; which was the only end for which they had deſired it; and not for their own ſakes, who pretended to be ſo abundantly ſatisfi'd with the Doctrines and Cuſtoms of Popery, as to wiſh the people could without diſturbing the Peace of the Empire, be brought to embrace it. And ſo having prevailed with the Emperor that it ſhould be proclaimed; proclaimed it was, and that with extraordinary Solemnities; firſt in the Camp,
<note place="margin">The Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> and afterwards over the whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, to the great Joy of the people; they that underſtood how it truly was, reckoning it however a good beginning; but for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality they believed it to be a Toleration of the whole of their Religion.</p>
            <p>The Patriarch hearing of the <hi>Toleration</hi> having been <hi>proclaimed;</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation againſt it.</note> and of the people rejoicing at it, as a <hi>Toleration of their whole Religion,</hi> he immediately drew up the following proteſtation againſt it, and ſent it to the Emperor.</p>
            <p>NOtwithſtanding I told your Highneſs, <hi>That your Subjects might be allowed to faſt on</hi> Wedneſdays <hi>inſtead of</hi> Saturdays, <hi>and might
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:57883:200"/>uſe their Offices, as by me amended; and excepting</hi> Eaſter <hi>and the Feſtivities depending thereon, that they might obſerve their Holidays as formerly; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I declared to your Highneſs at the ſame time, that it was not to be done by Proclamation, which as he that publiſheth them, publiſheth them as he thinks fit; ſo all that hear them, do underſtand and interpret them as they like beſt, as we ſee it has happened in the preſent caſe; for though I am ſatisfi'd that your Highneſs deſigned to grant no more by your Proclamation, but what was agreed on between us; yet as I am told, all the news every where is, that your Highneſs hath by a Proclamation commanded all your Subjects to return to the</hi> Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrian <hi>Faith; upon which conceit there have been extravagant rejoicings in your Highneſs's own Camp, to the great Mortification of all true Catholicks. Whatever it was that induced your Highneſs to do this, know you certainly, that God will one day call you to a ſtrict account for it. And that I and the Biſhop to whom the Holy Ghoſt hath committed the Government of this Church, which Chriſt purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with his blood, as it is ſaid in the</hi> Acts <hi>of the Apoſtles, may not be partakers of the ſame Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, We do jointly declare to your Highneſs, That in this Proclamation you have not obſerved that order that you ought to have done, which being a buſineſs of an Eccleſiaſtical nature, the publication thereof did not belong to your Highneſs, but to us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your Highneſs would do well to remember what the high Priest</hi> Azarias <hi>ſaid to King</hi> Ozias, <hi>in the Twenty Sixth Chapter of the ſecond Book of</hi> Chronicles; <hi>O</hi> Ozias, <hi>it is not your Office to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Incenſe to the Lord, but it is the Office of the
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:57883:201"/>Prieſts and the Sons of</hi> Aaron, <hi>who were Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to that Miniſtry. Therefore come forth of the Sanctuary, and deſpiſe not, for this thing will not be for your Honour in the ſight of God. Your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs would do well likewiſe to remember the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which immediately befel that King thereupon. And ſince it was not thought ſufficient to have theſe Proclamations publiſhed only in the Church, but it muſt be done alſo in the Camp, your Highneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ordered that, ought to have conſulted with ſome of the Fathers, or ſome other of your Chaplains, or with ſome perſon authorized by us to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, who would have taken care to have prevented the offence that it has given; for we are informed by ſome that were preſent at the Solemnity, that the people after the Proclamation were heard to ſay open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That now they were to have all their old Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices again without our amendments of them; and were to obſerve all their old Holidays, not excepting</hi> Eaſter <hi>and the Feſtivities that depend thereon; and that they were not left to their liberty, but were commanded not to faſt on</hi> Saturdays, <hi>but on</hi> Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſdays. <hi>Wherefore, that the laſt error may not be worſe than the firſt, your Highneſs muſt ſet forth a Second Proclamation with all neceſſary Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of your mind, at the framing whereof I do appoint Father</hi> James Mattos <hi>to be preſent in my place; and whereas it is not convenient that it ſhould be done without the concurrence of</hi> Abeto Baſilides; <hi>I do in the name of God require your Highneſs to acquaint him with it; and I do far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther admoniſh you to pray to the Father of Light for Light, that ſo you may not fix your eyes ſo much on an Earthly Kingdom which is tranſitory, as to loſe that of Heaven which is Eternal, and that on Earth likewiſe.</hi>

So that I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that any body ſhould have the impudence to ſay, That Thad changed the Faith to the great mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of Catholicks; when it is ſo plain that I have not made the leaſt alteration therein; neither did the Hereticks rejoyce ſo much as you ſpeak of, they having been all told before, that they were not to uſe their former Offices without your Emendations of them: They muſt therefore have been People of</hi> Factious Spirits <hi>and of</hi> Ill deſigns, <hi>that have put ſuch ſtories in your head, ſince we have done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what your Lordſhip had agreed to; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did they, who publiſhed our Proclamation, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther add or diminiſh any thing. Things being thus, your Lordſhip might very well have ſpared your bidding us</hi> Remember <hi>Ozias, and</hi> comparing us with one who was Puniſhed by God with the Leproſie for having taken the exerciſe of the Prieſtly Function upon himſelf; <hi>which as
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:57883:202"/>he ought not to have done, ſo we have never offered to do it; having only publiſhed a Proclamation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there was nothing that you had not agreed to when the</hi> Roman <hi>Faith firſt took footing in</hi> Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia;
<note place="margin">The Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits never wrought any Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia.</hi>

                     <hi>it was neither</hi> introduced into it by the Preaching of the Jeſuits, nor by any Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that were wrought by them, <hi>nor by no other means, but by our</hi> being convinced, that your Faith agreed with our Books, <hi>and that the Church of</hi> Ethiopia <hi>muſt therefore be in an Error; it was this induced us to Eſtabliſh the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Faith by our Commands and Proclamations, contrary to the</hi> Humour of our People, <hi>becauſe we believed it to be true; all which we did of our own accord, deſpiſing a viſible Kingdom in hopes of one that is inviſible. As to your Lordſhip's admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing us to fix our Eyes not</hi> on a Temporal <hi>but on a</hi> Heavenly Kingdom; How many Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects have I had Slaughtered? And how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Provinces have I loſt for having done ſo? <hi>I need not tell you</hi> their Numbers, <hi>you know them as well as I do my ſelf; ſo that I cannot for my life ſee, wherein I have offended God in this whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Had we been forced to have embraced your Faith, you might then have had ſome cauſe to be jealous that we have a mind to forſake it, but having vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily embraced it, we cannot undo what we have done, nor deſtroy what we have built.</hi>

            <p>This Letter, though it gave the Patriarch ſeveral Reprimands, as it did alſo his whole Order, in denying that any of them had
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:57883:203"/>ever wrought any Miracles in <hi>Ethiopia;</hi> which is very ſtrange, conſidering how many they pretend to work on all ſuch occaſions: Yet for the notice it gave him of a ſecond Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, and the aſſurance of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's reſolution to continue ſtedfaſt in the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith, he was ſo well ſatisfied with it, that he judged all things to be ſet pretty well to rights again; and reſuming his ancient courage thereupon, ventured to do a thing, which gave a terrible blow to his Patriarchal Authority.
<note place="margin">The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch is baffled in a great point of Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> The caſe was this; A certain Judge having turned Monk, denied to pay a yearly Penſion, which ſome Lands which he kept ſtill in his hands were charged with, to a certain Pariſh Prieſt; of which the Prieſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving complained to the Patriarch, he preſently commanded the Monk to pay the Prieſt his dues; but the Monk, inſtead of obeying, denied that he had any Juriſdiction over him, appealing from him to the General of his Order, as the proper Prelate in all ſuch caſes; and the Cauſe coming to be Tried at Court, the Patriarch was caſt, the Judges having given their Opinion, <hi>That the Patriarch having no more Power than their former</hi> Abuna<hi>'s, had no Authority over the Monks, which the Patriarch had hitherto pretended to,</hi> and had conſtantly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed; having in this, and an hundred things beſides, extended his Juriſdiction beyond what any of the <hi>Abuna</hi>'s had done.</p>
            <p>The Country being put in a pretty good humour by the Toleration, which, according to the Patriarch's fears, was every where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended beyond its intention, the Emperor ſets
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:57883:203"/>about raiſing a great Army to go againſt the Peaſants; who would not be ſatisfied with any thing <hi>under the Re-eſtabliſhment of their Old Religion,</hi> and <hi>the Baniſhing the Patriarch and the Fathers out of</hi> Ethiopia, <hi>as the Cauſes of all the Blood that had been ſhed in it for ſeveral Years.</hi> But the raiſing of ſuch an Army as the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror deſigned, requiring time, his Brother, by the advice of the <hi>Alexandrians,</hi> was ſent before to ſtreighten them with a Flying Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. <hi>Raz Cella</hi> upon his being denied his Old Troops, which were intirely at his devotion, would fain have been excuſed from going on this Expedition; but the Emperor preſſed him ſo hard, that he ſaw he muſt either break with him, or do it; and as his heart miſgave him all the way he went, ſo his Succeſs was anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his forebodings, for he was no ſooner got among the Mouniains,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Raz Cella</hi> is routed by the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants.</note> than he was fallen upon by a Body of Twenty thouſand Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants; and being Deſerted by his own Men, moſt of which went over to the Enemy, he narrowly eſcaped being made Priſoner. The <hi>Alexandrians,</hi> who it is probable had ſent him againſt the Peaſants on purpoſe to be beat by them, could not conceal their joy on the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of this Defeat; the blame whereof they laid wholy at his door, which ſunk him ſo low, that he was never able to riſe again to do the <hi>Roman</hi> Church any ſervice. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror fearing leaſt the Peaſants might upon this advantage have advanced towards <hi>Dancas,</hi> retired from thence to <hi>Gojam,</hi> to be at a greater diſtance from them; where having made up an Army, that conſiſted chiefly of
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:57883:204"/>
               <hi>Gauls,</hi> being afraid to truſt his own Subjects any longer, he went to offer the Peaſants a Battel; who ſince their late Victory over <hi>Raz Cella,</hi> had ventured down into the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, reckoning themſelves ſtrong enough to Fight any Army the Emperor could bring againſt them. The Two Armies having looked each other in the face for ſome Hours, the Emperor,
<note place="margin">The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror marcheth againſt them.</note> who had placed a ſtout Body of <hi>Gauliſh</hi> Horſe in the Front, ordered them to fall on, which they did ſo furiouſly, that at the firſt Onſet, which is commonly the laſt too with the <hi>Habaſſin</hi> Armies, they broke through the Peaſants main body, which Diſperſed immediately, and Throwing down their Arms, fled towards the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; the <hi>Gauls</hi> purſued them till night came on;
<note place="margin">He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a great Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</note> ſo that though few or none of them were killed Fighting, there were Eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of them found dead next morning; whereas had they had the Courage to have fought it out, they might, with half that loſs, have had a Victory; for had they but rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Gauls,</hi> who charged them firſt, it is certain the Imperial <hi>Habaſſins</hi> would either have gone over to them, or have thrown down their Arms. The Court-<hi>Alexandrians,</hi> though they were extreamly mortified by this great blow, yet did ſo manage the matter, that they gained their point by it; for having perſuaded the Emperor to go next morning to view the Field, which was covered all over with dead bodies, and obſerving him to be touched with ſo direful a ſight, they came about him, and with Tears in their
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:57883:204"/>eyes told him, <hi>Six, You ſee how many dead bodies are lying here; Whoſe were all theſe? Were they the Bodies of</hi> Mahometans <hi>or</hi> Heathens? <hi>No, not ſo much as one of them, but they were all to a man your Highneſs's Natural-born Subjects, and our own Blood and Kindred;</hi> we do therefore beg of your Highneſs to conſider, <hi>That this is a War in which, whether you Conquer or are Beat, you thruſt a Sword into your own Bowels. Neither were theſe poor wretches, you ſee lying here, diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with your Highneſs for any thing, but for forcing a New Religion upon them: How many Thouſands have already loſt their Lives in this Quarrel? and how many Thouſands more muſt be Maſſacred before Popery can be eſtabliſhed in</hi> Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opia? <hi>Wherefore, for God's ſake, Sir,</hi>

               <hi>let your People alone with the Religion of their Fathers; which you muſt either do, or reſolve to deſtroy your Empire with your own hands.</hi> We muſt tell your Highneſs farther, That the very <hi>Gauls and Heathens do condemn us for what we are doing,</hi> calling us <hi>Apoſtates</hi> and <hi>Renega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do's for having forſaken the Religion of our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors.</hi> And that they might clinch the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Prince and <hi>Amana Christos,</hi> had got the <hi>Gauls,</hi> as the Emperor paſſed by them, to cry out, <hi>That they would ſerve him no longer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quite weary of Cutting poor Mens Throats for no other reaſon but becauſe they would not leave the Religion they had been Born and Bred in.</hi> The Empreſs interpoſed likewiſe, and deſired him <hi>for God's ſake, and his own, and his Poſterities, not to go on deſtroying his Subjects at ſuch a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs rate; and to conſider that in all his Wars with them, he did, as it were, but cut off his left hand
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:57883:205"/>with his right; and whether any thing could be more diſhonourable, than for a Prince to employ Foreigners and Heathens to Maſſacre his Chriſtian Subjects; and all this to introduce a Religion into</hi> Ethiopia, <hi>which it was plain to all the World, it would never be reconciled to?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe paſſionate Remonſtrances one upon the neck of another, together with the ſad ſight of ſo many dead bodies, did affect the Emperor ſo much, that inſtead of returning to <hi>Dancaz</hi> in triumph after ſo great a Victory, he returned thither ſo extreamly diſconſolate, that he did not care to ſee or ſpeak with any body.</p>
            <p>The Patriarch, Biſhops, and Fathers, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how things went, haſtened to Court, not to <hi>Congratulate</hi> the Emperor upon his late Victory, for that their Friends had told them, he <hi>could not bear,</hi> but to ſee if they could get him out of the hands of the <hi>Alexandrians,</hi> who at preſent were in full poſſeſſion of him, the Champions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith being all either Dead, or in Diſgrace at Court.</p>
            <p>We are not told what paſſed betwixt the Emperor and the Patriarch at his firſt Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; but whatever it was, a great Council was called a few days after, to conſider the ſtate of the Empire, and by what means the Peace thereof might be reſtored; in which it was quickly agreed, <hi>That there was no other way of doing it, but by reſtoring all the</hi> Alexandrian <hi>Rites and Cuſtoms, and by leaving People to their Liberty to be of which of the two Religions they pleaſed.</hi> This Reſolution is ſaid to have been oppoſed by one <hi>Abithaca Johanes,</hi> a Nephew of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:57883:205"/>who told the Council boldly, <hi>That all the Miſeries of</hi> Ethiopia <hi>were owing to their Sins, and not to Popery's having been Establiſhed in it.</hi> To whom the Council gave no other anſwer, but that <hi>ſomething must be done to reſtore the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to its former peace; and that there was nothing would do it, but what they had agreed to do.</hi> The Patriarch being alarm'd with this reſolution of the Council,

            <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
               <body>
                  <p>SIR, <hi>I thought we had had the Victory in the laſt Fight, but I now begin to underſtand that we had the worſt on't; for notwithſtanding in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity the deſign of the Rebels was to have taken your Crown from you, nevertheleſs what they gave out was, that they fought only to have the Religion of their Fathers reſtored; ſo that if they ſhould gain that point, though they were beat, they may be reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to have been Victorious; but as before the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement was the proper time for the making of Vows and Promiſes, ſo now is the time for fulfilling them. In order to Engage God to confer more ſuch mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies upon you, who by this laſt Victory has as it were ſet his ſeal to all the former, and that for no other end but to oblige your Highneſs to advance his holy Faith, under the banner whereof you obtained it. Beſides, it was the Catholicks that are in your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:57883:206"/>that did the work, and who are not ſo few as your Highneſs is told they are. The reaſon why they do not appear to be numerous, is becauſe they have no favour ſhew'd them; whereas if your Highneſs would but be pleaſed to call them about your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and beſtow all Offices of Honour and Truſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, you would quickly ſee how they would mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply, and how by that means both your Empire and the faith would flouriſh; whereas of late they have been kept from coming near you, none but Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents having been admitted into your Councils;</hi> a whole Neſt of which Serpents <hi>did on</hi> Friday <hi>laſt aſſemble together in the Hall of your Palace, where they treated no longer about the out-works of Religion, but laid the ax to the root, conſulting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether how they might deſtroy the Catholick Faith; which they agreed at laſt, to</hi> put to <hi>the Vote, by lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the People and Soldiers to be of which Religion they like beſt; who whenever they are asked whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will have Chriſt or</hi> Barabbas, <hi>will certainly prefer</hi> Barabbas, <hi>for having been of their own Office and Profeſſion. Sir, Matters of Faith are not to be treated in ſuch a manner, but are to be ſetled by Councils conſiſting of great numbers of Biſhops, where they may be had, or elſe of Grave and Learned Prieſts and Friars: For though in Matters of State, theſe very men do not think fit to conſult with every body, but only with perſons of known Prudence and Experience;</hi> nevertheleſs <hi>in Matters of Religion, the</hi> Otadores, Gauls, Mahometans <hi>and</hi> Heathens, <hi>are reckoned to be good Counſellors; and are all called in by them to determine which is the true, and which is the falſe faith. I would have your Highneſs call to mind the many mercies God hath conferred on you ſince you
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:57883:206"/>embraced the</hi> Roman <hi>Faith; and though it is true there have been many Rebellions, which is a Plague</hi> Ethiopia <hi>never was, nor never will be free from, until the Faith is deeply rooted therein; yet God has always been ſo kind to you, as to lay the Rebels at your feet, and particularly in the laſt Fight, when your affairs were come to a criſis;</hi> ſo that <hi>your Arm is not ſhortned, but extended. Remember likewiſe, that you did not forſake the Faith of</hi> Ethiopia <hi>out of fear, the Fathers being in no condition to oblige you to do it by force of Arms, but you did it purely upon your being convinced of its falſhood, and of the truth of that of</hi> Rome: <hi>Neither muſt you forget, that I did not come to you of my own head, but was ſent by the</hi> Roman <hi>Pontiff, and your Brother the King of</hi> Portugal, <hi>upon your having writ to them ſeveral time to ſend you a Patriarch and ſome Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops;</hi> in which affair if there <hi>was any delay, it was occaſioned by the jealouſy they had of the fickle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the</hi> Habaſſins, <hi>which we now begin to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; and which the King of</hi> Portugal <hi>had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had experience of when he ſent</hi> Don Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher De Gama <hi>hither with a ſtout body of Troops, by whom this Empire was reſcued out of the hands of the</hi> Mahometans (who had Conquer'd it) <hi>and that not with an intention of keeping it to themſelves, but of reſtoring it to your Anceſtors, as they did: Neither had the King of</hi> Portugal <hi>ever any other view, nor did he expect any other reward for what he did for you, but only your Friendſhip, and the union of this Empire with the</hi> Roman <hi>Church; to which end I and the Biſhop that is here behind me were ſent by his Holineſs and his Majeſty to you: Neither did we come among you as Beggars, but well ſtored with Books, and Pontifical Veſtments
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:57883:207"/>and Ornaments, they not being willing to charge your Highneſs with ſo much as the Maintenance of our perſons. Conſider, Sir, how juſt cauſe thoſe Princes will have to be diſpleaſed with you; and though they may be at too great a diſtance to have due ſatisfaction, God nevertheleſs, who is every where, will not fail to require it of you: Conſider likewiſe, what a blot this will be in the Scutcheon of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of</hi> Judah, <hi>and what an eternal ſtain both to your own and your Empire's honour, and how many Souls you will ruin by your Apoſtacy; which, that I may not live to ſee, nor the Divine Judgments that will befal you thereupon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror continues immovea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in his reſolution.</note> 
                     <hi>let me beg it of your Highneſs to command my head to be here ſtruck off before you.</hi>

            <p>At theſe words the Patriarch, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and Five Fathers, threw themſelves at the Emperor's Feet, to receive his anſwer.

            <p>Only making a ſign with his hand that they ſhould riſe, he asked the Patriarch <hi>with what face he could ſay that he had not ſhewed favour to the Catholicks, ſince he had favoured none elſe but ſuch? but the Hereticks,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>are nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and all that have rebelled againſt me, have given no other reaſon for their doing it, but my ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving changed the Religion of my Countrey.

            <pb n="390" facs="tcp:57883:208"/>
            <p>The Patriarch, who was for leaving no ſtone unturned, went from the Emperor to wait upon the Prince, and having told him the ſame ſtory he told his Father, the Prince ſeemed to be ſurprized with the news, and returned ſuch Anſwers as would have impoſed upon a weak Man; but the Patriarch know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to be Maſter of a moſt profound Diſſimulation, and an inveterate Enemy to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, gathered from his ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous Anſwers, <hi>That without a Miracle the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Faith could not be much longer ſupported in</hi> Ethiopia.

            <p>The <hi>Alexandrians,</hi> that they might bring the Emperor under a neceſſity of executing what had been agreed on in Council, had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly ſpread a report, That on St. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi>'s day their Ancient Faith was to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to them; which report having brought all the Countrey to the Camp to be preſent at the Solemnity, they then told the Emperor, That there was no remedy but he <hi>muſt either Reſtore to his People the Religion of their Fathers, or run a great hazard of his Crown, ſince the Pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who were come in ſuch</hi> vaſt multitudes in hopes of having it done, if they were diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed would be thrown into ſuch a Fury, that no body <hi>could tell where it might end:</hi> The Emperor made anſwer, That he was willing his <hi>good Subjects ſhould enjoy their Old Religion;</hi> but that he might not be worſe than his word to the Patriarch, he commanded ſome of his Servants to go and wait upon him, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint

               <hi>Za Mariam,</hi> who was in the number of thoſe that were commanded to carry this Meſſage to the Patriarch, being admitted to ſpeak with him, told him in the Emperor's Name and words, <hi>We have embraced your Faith, and have been at much pains about it, but our Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do not care for it; ſo, though it was really out of hatred to</hi> Raz Cella, <hi>that</hi> Julius <hi>took up Arms, nevertheleſs the pretence that helped him to an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, was, that he would defend the Old Religion; who, with vaſt multitudes of People that had flocked in to him, was deſtroyed:</hi> Cabrael <hi>and</hi> Guergis <hi>uſed the ſame pretence, and had the ſame ſucceſs: And</hi> Cerca Chriſtos, <hi>and the Peaſants who are now in Arms, have no Quarrel with me, but for having prohibited them the exerciſe of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. The Faith of</hi> Rome <hi>is not bad; but as I have told you formerly, my People do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, and are very well contented to live and die in the Religion they were brought up in: I am reſolved therefore, ſince they are ſo fond of it, to let them alone with it; and if there are any that are inclinable to the</hi> Roman <hi>Faith, they ſhall have free Liberty to Profeſs it, as the</hi> Portugueſes, <hi>who have been among us ever ſince the Reign of</hi> Aſnaf Saged, <hi>have had.</hi> When <hi>Mariam</hi> had done ſpeaking, the Patriarch asked him, Whether it was by the Emperor's <hi>Expreſs Order that he had delivered him that Meſſage?</hi> Mariam told him <hi>it was:</hi> The Patriarch made no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, <hi>But that</hi> Ethiopia <hi>had never been without Wars before the</hi> Roman <hi>Faith was known in it,
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:57883:209"/>and that he would return an Anſwer to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror after he had adviſed with his Brethren:</hi> Who having conſulted together, drew up the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Manifeſto,</hi> which they ſent to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror by Father <hi>Manuel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>YOUR Highneſs has ſent me word,
<note place="margin">The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch's <hi>manifeſto</hi> againſt it.</note> That being upon the point of loſing your Empire for your Zeal to eſtabliſh the</hi> Roman <hi>Religion, you are reſolved to let your People alone with their Old Faith, and that you will at the ſame time grant Liberty to all that ſhall have a mind to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Popery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir, My Affection for you is nothing inferior to that I have for the King of</hi> Portugal; <hi>being as ready to condeſcend to every thing that is for the Intereſt of your Kingdoms, as you can deſire, provided it do not claſh with the Purity of the Faith; for as whatever is a Sin can never be for the good of any Kingdom, ſo neither can I grant any ſuch thing, neither ought your Highneſs to deſire it of me. There are two things to be obſerved in this great Affair; the one concerns the Peaſants, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving never embraced the</hi> Roman <hi>Faith, your Highneſs may for ſome time wink at their living in the Hereſie of their Fathers; the other, concerns thoſe who have embraced the</hi> Roman <hi>Faith, and Communicated with that Church, and not only ſo, but have obliged themſelves by Oaths to be always Obedient to her: Now to theſe your Highneſs cannot ſay, You may, if you pleaſe, live in the Faith of your Fathers, ſince it would be a grievous Sin againſt God in you to do ſo, as it would be in me likewiſe if I ſhould either advife you to it, or conſent to your doing it: And were it lawful for one that is a
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:57883:209"/>Foreigner, to meddle with your Government, or to give advice about it, I would tell you, that it is my Opinion, That your Highneſs will certainly Ruin your Empire by granting Liberty of Conſcience, which muſt neceſſarily fill it with Diſſentions and Civil Wars; For what but Blood and Wars can follow, upon one part of your Subjects being for the</hi> Roman, <hi>and the other part for the</hi> Alexandrian <hi>Faith? And muſt not the having of an</hi> Abuna <hi>for one Party, and a Patriarch for the other, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly end in Two Kingdoms, and Two Kings?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether the Patriarch believed the Popiſh Party to be ſo Numerous in <hi>Ethiopia</hi> as to have made a conſiderable diviſion therein up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Toleration, or talked ſo only to terrifie the Emperor; it is certain, that the Tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was no ſooner publiſhed, than the whole Body of the Court and Countrey returned to their Old Religion; inſomuch that Father <hi>Manuel</hi> happening, after he had delivered the Patriarch's <hi>Manifeſto</hi> to the Emperor, to tell him, <hi>That by granting Liberty of Conſcience he would undoubtedly Ruin his Kingdom;</hi> the Emperor taking him up ſhort, asked him, <hi>How that was poſſible, ſince he had no Empire left to Ruin?</hi> And ſo diſmiſſed him. And whereas formerly the Fathers, when they left the Emperor, uſed to be conducted out of the Court with Ceremony, there was no body now took the leaſt notice of Father <hi>Manuel,</hi> unleſs it were to make Faces at him as he paſſed through the Rooms; but the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was not got out of the Court, when the Drums beat for the Publiſhing of the Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:57883:210"/>which he came to have put a ſtop to; the Proclamation was as followeth:</p>
            <q>
               <hi>HEAR,
<note place="margin">The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation for reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the <hi>Alexandri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> Hear: We formerly gave you the</hi> Roman <hi>Faith, believing it to be true; but innumerable multitudes of my People having been ſlain upon that account, under the Command of</hi> Julius, Guergis, Cerca Chriſtos, <hi>&amp;c. as now alſo among the Peaſants; We do therefore Reſtore the Religion of your Fathers to you, ſo that your Prieſts are to take Poſſeſſion of their Churches again, and to officiate therein as formerly.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>Never was any Proclamation received with greater expreſſions of Joy than this was, there being nothing to be heard in or about the Camp for ſome Hours for the noiſe of the Trumpets,
<note place="margin">Exceſſive Joy and Feſtivities thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> and of innumerable multitudes of People continually ecchoing each other from all quarters of the Camp with acclamations and ſhouts of, <hi>God Bleſs the Emperor, and let the</hi> Alexandrian <hi>Faith Flouriſh.</hi> At Night the whole Camp and Countrey was <hi>Illuminated</hi> with Bonfires; into which moſt, if not all of the Popiſh Converts <hi>threw the Beads and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques</hi> that had been given them by the <hi>Fathers;</hi> and that with ſo much <hi>Contempt and Indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> as abundantly manifeſted that they had never had any <hi>inward Reſpect</hi> for their <hi>New Religion,</hi> but had only profeſs'd it out of fear.</p>
            <p>The Patriarch and Fathers, though morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to the laſt degree by this ſudden change of things, nevertheleſs ſince the publick Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Worſhip was not prohibited, they went on faying <hi>their Maſſes</hi> as formerly;
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:57883:210"/>and on the Sunday following the Proclamation,
<note place="margin">The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch is adviſed by his friends to give over preaching.</note> The Patriarch himſelf <hi>Preached</hi> in the Camp, with <hi>ſome Paſſages of whoſe Sermon,</hi> (for he could not forbear reflecting ſeverely upon what had been done) the <hi>Alexandrians</hi> were ſo much <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,</hi> that he was adviſed by his Friends to forbear Preaching, till the ſtorm the late Proclamation had raifed, was a little abated, which, they ſaid, it would be the ſooner for its being ſo extreamly violent.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Alexandrians,</hi> who could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently forget how hard they had been rid by the Patriareh and Fathers when they were in the ſaddle, were never ſatisfied till they had all their Churches and Lands taken from them;
<note place="margin">The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts</hi> have all their Churches and Lands taken from them. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and is Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by his Son, <hi>Baſilides.</hi>
               </note> and had obtained a ſecond Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which Commanded <hi>all the People of</hi> Ethiopia <hi>to be of the</hi> Alexandrian, <hi>and of no other Faith.</hi> The Emperor did not long ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive this Revolution, dying the <hi>September</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of an Hectick Fever, in the Sixty firſt year of his Age. The Fathers will have him to have died in the Communion of their Church. But however that were, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, he was buried by the <hi>Habaſſin</hi> Monks, and with their Offices, in the Church of <hi>Ganeta Jeſu,</hi> which they had taken from the Fathers.</p>
            <p>The Prince <hi>Baſilides</hi> being Proclaimed Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror ſo ſoon as the breath was out of his Father's Body, <hi>Raz Cella</hi> coming amongſt the reſt of the Grandees to Swear Allegiance to him, was received by him with all the marks of Honour and Affection that his near Relation to him could pretend to; the Emperor, among
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:57883:211"/>other kind things, telling him, <hi>That hereafter he ſhould look upon him, and treat him as his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, rather than as his Uncle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whatever was the matter, this kindneſs betwixt the Nephew and Uncle was not long-liv'd; the Fathers pretend that <hi>Raz Cella</hi>'s conſtant Zeal for their Religion, was the cauſe of it; and particularly, his having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the Emperor with his Father's having appeared to him, and commanded him to tell him, that it was a madneſs to loſe an Eternal Kingdom, to ſecure one that was Tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: But what is certain is, that the Emperor giving no credit to his Uncle's <hi>Viſion,</hi>

               </note> 
               <hi>My Lords, what We ſay and write unto you; You cannot be ignorant of our being ingaged in a War with the Peaſants of</hi> Laſta, <hi>and of our Empires not having had one hours Reſt ſince this War begun: You muſt therefore ſend us the Muskets and Carabines, and all your other Arms; together with all the Powder and Bullets that you have in your keeping: We have ſent</hi> Daniel <hi>and</hi> Miſerata Chriſtos <hi>to receive them, to whom you muſt not fail to deliver them; and when the War is over, they ſhall all be reſtored to you again; or if you are willing to ſell them,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:57883:211"/>they will give you your price for them. There is an</hi> Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrian Abuna <hi>arrived here, he has been for ſome time</hi> Incognito <hi>in the Kingdom of</hi> Narea; <hi>and who when I deſired him to Confer holy Orders, made me anſwer,</hi> He could not do it ſo long as there was a <hi>Roman</hi> Patriarch about us; <hi>for which reaſon we command your Lordſhip to repair to</hi> Fremona, <hi>and to take all your Fathers, and Books, and Goods with you; we ſhall take care to appoint a Captain to attend you thither with a ſtrong guard; with which Orders the Meſſengers carried a verbal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, which was,</hi> That if any opportunity for the <hi>Indies</hi> ſhould offer, the Patriarch, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and Fathers, had free leave to make uſe of it.</q>
            <p>The Patriarch when he was ſerved with this Order, complained the Emperor was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard upon them, and that he could not judge otherwiſe but that his deſign in taking their Arms from them at the ſame time he ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed them to <hi>Fremona,</hi> was, that they ſhould be all Murthered by the way; as to the Arms, he ſaid, they owed nothing to <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and as he was reſolved never to give them away, ſo he was no Gunſmith to ſell Arms. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs if they were reſolved to have them from him, they might find them in ſuch a place, but that he would declare to all the World that he was robbed of them; but having before the Meſſengers had ſeized the Arms, received advice that Father <hi>James</hi> was likewiſe ſerved with an order, to deliver all the Cannon, Muskets and Armour for Man and Horſe that were in his Cuſtody; He
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:57883:212"/>ſent for the Meſſengers and told them, That he now ſaw plainly what the Emperor's deſign was in demanding their Arms, and that he would therefore write to his Highneſs about it before he parted with them; but the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers being very urgent to have the Arms out of his Cuſtody, he agreed that they ſhould be depoſited in the hands of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they would name, till he had an anſwer from the Emperor.</p>

On the ſame Ships with theſe Arms, there came ſeveral Cannons and Muskets which were all carried back to the</hi> Indies; <hi>only for the guard of my perſon, the King's Officers gave me Twenty four Muskets, and a few Carabines; of the Carabines I have not one left, having parted with them all to your Father, and ſome of the Grandees; and of the Muskets, I gave Fourteen to your Father, Two to</hi> Raz Cella Chriſtos, <hi>one to</hi> Caba Chriſtos, <hi>and one to</hi> Guergis, <hi>keeping Six only for the guard of my own Houſe and Perſon; which, as they are all I have, ſo they are all very much at your Highneſs's ſervice; though at the ſame time I cannot forbear telling your Highneſs, that your Father on ſeveral occaſions ſent Catabines both to me and the Fathers, with which
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:57883:212"/>we never did harm to any body, nor were they of any other uſe to us, but to affright Robbers, and other ill-diſpoſed people. And whereas your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is pleaſed to Baniſh us to a place, to which we cannot go but thorough vaſt Deſerts, we might rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably have expected that you would have done us the ſame favour; but inſtead of that, to take the Six Muskets from me which are my whole guard, is in effect to take away all my Church-Ornaments and Books, which are my whole Treaſure, if not my Life, this being to give the world to underſtand, that they have free leave to Murther the Biſhop and the Fathers: This I know very well is the deſign of thoſe that gave you this advice, though they will not let your Highneſs know ſo much; for though I am ſenſible how pure an heart lodgeth in your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs's breaſt, and how like you are to your Father; yet you have undoubtedly thoſe about you, that are contriving how they may have us all Murthered; and as there are ſeveral things, which they have Extorted from your Highneſs by their Importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; ſo this of baniſhing us to</hi> Fremona <hi>is one of them, which is done by them with an Intention of having us all Murthered, either by the way, or when we are there, of which your Highneſs is to know nothing until it will be too late to remedy it. The Lion when his Teeth and Claws are broke, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſport of the Monkies; and notwithſtanding the guilt of our Blood may lie upon others, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace thereof will fall upon your Highneſs: For what can the world ſay but that you diſarmed us on purpoſe that we might be Robbed and Murthered; and that after having ty'd us hand and foot, you threw us in the way of Soldiers and Robbers? I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed likewiſe, that your Highneſs has ſent the

Now this being our caſe, your Highneſs would do us a great favour if you would command us all to be ſlain here, where our bodies will not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by Wolves; or if you would be ſo kind, as to command us to be put to death in the Camp; I do promiſe to come in my richeſt Pontificals to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo that Blow which would I hope be precious in the Sight of God.

What is offered in juſtification of their not yielding to this, to wit, that they ſhall incur an Excommunication if they do it, is intolerable; ſince the Patriarch of</hi> Alexandria, <hi>no nor the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, has not power to lay an Excommunication upon his Subjects on that account; and the reaſon is, becauſe ſuch an Excommunication would tend to the Deſtruction of the Faith, which is known and made manifeſt by the Diſputations of Learned men. It is likewiſe contrary to the expreſs command of God, and his Apoſtles, St.</hi> Peter <hi>and St.</hi> Paul; <hi>Chriſt having commanded his Diſciples, and in them his whole Church to go and teach all Nations,</hi> Jews, Gentiles <hi>and</hi> Hereticks; <hi>and again,</hi> to ſeek and they ſhould find, knock, and it ſhould be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them. <hi>And how is truth ſought, or how are its gates knocked at, but by Diſputations? It is alſo contrary to what St.</hi> Peter <hi>ordered, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands all Chriſtians to be always prepared to give ſatisfaction to all that ſhould deſire a reaſon of the hope that is in them; and in the laſt place, it is a contradiction to St.</hi> Paul, <hi>who told his Diſciple</hi> Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy, <hi>that a Biſhop ought to be a Doctor; and writing to</hi> Titus, <hi>he declares wherein that Doctor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip conſiſts, and that it does, in being</hi> ſo powerful in ſound Doctrine, as to be able to convince Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers. <hi>Wherefore if your Learned men do think that we contradict the truth, why do they not endeavour to convince us of it, and not ſeek to excuſe their not endeavouring it, by pretending that by ingaging in a Diſputation with us, they ſhould fall under the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication of Three hundred and Eighteen Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:57883:215"/>there being no manner of foundation for that pretence, ſince</hi> Hoſius, Victor, <hi>and</hi> Vincentius, <hi>the Preſidens of that Council, were all the Legates of Pope</hi> Sylveſter, <hi>the Maſter of</hi> Conſtantine <hi>the Great; who undoubtedly never drew the Sword of Excommunication againſt themſelves to thruſt it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their own Bowels; wherefore to flee to Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication in ſuch a caſe, is to truſt to a covering that cannot hide the ignorance of him that ſeeks to cover himſelf with it.</hi>

                     <hi>We have received your Letter, and do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand all that it contains: As to your deſiring to know why we have turned you out of the Poſt wherein God and the Emperor had placed you: Your Lordſhip cannot but be ſenſible, that ſo long as we were under our Father the Emperor, we never diſobeyed him in any one thing; nor did we ever ſo much as open our mouth againſt any thing that he did; but were ſo ſubmiſſive to him in all things, that we never ſaid, I will have this, or I will have that; or I like this, or diſlike that; inſomuch, that I do not remember, that during his life, I ever did any thing of my own head, but did ſtill what he Commanded me. As to the buſineſs of your Religion, our Soul never entered into its Councils,
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:57883:216"/>neither did we ever joyn with any Counſellors ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to build it up, or deſtroy it. We need not be told that the Emperor ſent for your Lordſhip, and that the Fathers likewiſe came with his Conſent; as we need not, that ever ſince your coming he has been continually embroiled in Wars for endeavouring to eſtabliſh your Faith; Fighting ſometimes with his Sons, and at other times with his Slaves, whom he had raiſed from the dunghil to great honours: Inſomuch that from the firſt hour we were able to bear Arms, we have never done any thing, but fight in obedience to our Father's Commands, which we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways obeyed. After the Battel I had in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Winter with</hi> Ognadega, <hi>our Learned Monks and People having aſſembled themſelves together in the Camp, took the confidence to tell my Father their thoughts freely in the following words;</hi> Sir, How long are we to be plagued thus, and to tire our ſelves about things that are good for nothing? We deſire to know, When we are to give over fighting with our Kinsfolk and Brethren; or cutting our right hand off with our left? <hi>What great difference is there betwixt the</hi> Roman <hi>Faith and ours? For do they of</hi> Rome <hi>teach, That there are Two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in Chriſt; and have not we always believed and taught the ſame, in affirming that our Lord Chriſt is perfect God and perfect Man; perfect Man as to his Humanity, and perfect God as to his Divinity? But whereas thoſe his Two Natures are not ſeparated, his Divinity being United to the Fleſh, and not ſeparated from it, and his Fleſh to the Divinity; we do not for that reaſon affirm them to be Two, but One; being made ſo out of two Cauſes, and that not ſo as to Confound and
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:57883:217"/>Mix thoſe Natures in their Beings; but on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their being one and the ſame Principle, we call them by the name of that Union; ſo that our Controverſie with them in this matter is of ſmall importance: Neither was it the cauſe of our ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had ſo much fighting, but it was becauſe they denied us the</hi> Blood in the Communion, <hi>not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding Chriſt has told us poſitively in his Goſpel, that</hi> unleſs we eat the fleſh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, you ſhall not inherit eternal Life. <hi>And notwithſtanding that Chriſt himſelf, when he Inſtituted the Sacrament, after having given his Body to his Diſciples, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it himſelf, did not ſay,</hi> The blood is in my fleſh which I have given you; <hi>but on the contrary, he ſaid,</hi> Take and drink, and divide it among you: <hi>His Diſciples doing as he Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, and as he gave them to underſtand by ſaying,</hi> Do this in remembrance of me. <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was this the only thing that diſcontented the People; but moreover the prohibiting them to Faſt on</hi> Wedneſdays; <hi>which St.</hi> Peter <hi>and St.</hi> Paul, <hi>and no fewer than Eight Synods, had Commanded them to do, upon pain of Excommunication. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was that all, but becauſe they ſaw us Eat and Drink in the firſt week of Lent; Eating on the Morning of</hi> Good Friday; <hi>from which time till</hi> Eaſter <hi>they do never taſte any thing: They heard likewiſe, that we received the Sacrament in the Morning on Faſting-days; and that the</hi> Roman <hi>Church permits People on Faſting-days to eat Milk and Butter, and to drink Water; having changed all the Feſtivities of the Year, and ſuffering Men and Women promiſcuouſly to enter into the Church, without keeping any out for being unclean. But
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:57883:217"/>the things of all others for which they abhorred us the moſt, was for ſaying, That they Baptized themſelves as if they were</hi> Heathens <hi>and</hi> Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans; <hi>whereas, in truth, there is no great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the</hi> Romaniſts <hi>and them as to that point: And becauſe the</hi> Romaniſts <hi>treated</hi> their Prieſts and Deacons, as if they had not been in Holy Orders, giving them Prieſthood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Prieſthood, and Diaconate upon Diaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; <hi>and for burning ſome of their Altars for no other reaſon, but becauſe they were made of Wood, and Conſecrating thoſe again that were made of Stone, as if they had been Profane before; The Monks were alſo inraged againſt the</hi> Romaniſts <hi>for not living like Monks, who are not to be left to their liberty whether they will Faſt or not; and becauſe the Fathers took ſtate upon them, and did not viſit them according to the Cuſtom of Monks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For theſe and divers other reaſons, the People far and near were much diſcontented, and ſaid to the Emperor,</hi> Hear what we have to ſay, and either give us leave to live quietly, or knock us on the head, ſince the War does thicken upon us daily. <hi>When the Emperor was told this by all his People, he, without our joyning with them in it, finding that there was no other way to quiet their minds, and that he would not be able to puniſh them much longer, commanded his Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors to adviſe together what was beſt to be done; who after a ſerious conſult came to this Reſolution,</hi> That they muſt all return to their Ancient Religion and Cuſtoms.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Your Lordſhip in being acquainted with this, will know the reaſon why you are turned out of your Place, which God and the Emperor had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:57883:218"/>on you; and that the very ſame Emperor that ſent for your Lordſhip, and gave you your Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, was the Perſon that deprived you of it: Wherefore ſince an</hi> Alexandrian <hi>Abuna is on his way hither, and he has ſent us word, that he cannot be in the ſame Countrey with a</hi> Roman <hi>Patriarch and Fathers; we have ordered you to Repair to</hi> Fremona, <hi>and there to remain. As to what your Lordſhip now offers, which is, That if the People of</hi> Ethiopia <hi>will but continue in the Obedience of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, that you will diſpenſe with them as to all matters which are not contrary to the Faith; that comes too late now; for how is it poſſible for them</hi> to return to that which they have not only forſaken, but do abominate, now they have had a taſte of their Old Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion again? <hi>For</hi> can a grown Man be born again, or enter a ſecond time into his Mother's womb? <hi>Your Lordſhip further deſires, That we would aſſemble our Learned Men to Diſpute with you before you depart, about matters of Faith: This ought alſo to have been done in the beginning; beſides,</hi> Is that Cauſe like to be ſupported by Arguments, which has been maintained hitherto only by Force and Violence? By taking Eſtates from ſome,
<note place="margin">The Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of the Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons raiſed by the Jeſuits.</note> and throwing others into Priſon, and Puniſhing others more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely; and that for no other reaſon, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would not embrace your Faith? <hi>And as if that had not been ſufficient,</hi> you have dragg'd great multitudes out of the Deſarts, who would have been contented to have lived there upon Herbs, and confined them to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; nay, the poor People that would have been glad to have Buried themſelves in Caves, not
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:57883:218"/>having eſcaped your Perſecution. <hi>Now what a</hi> Barbarity <hi>would it be, to go and teaſe poor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with Arguments, who have ſuffered ſo much in Deſarts and Baniſhments? It would certainly be a very unjuſt thing, both in the ſight of God and Man. As to your Lordſhip's deſiring to have a</hi> Portugueſe <hi>Guard to attend you, that cannot be; but we ſhall appoint a very Honeſt Man, and who has a great train of Servants, to convey your Lordſhip, and all your Goods in ſafety, to the place whither you are to go.</hi>

            <p>This Letter gives us a great deal of light into the Affairs of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> at this time. For Firſt; We ſee plainly thereby, that Popery, as to its Perſecuting ſpirit, is the ſame in all Climates; it having no ſooner got the Power of the Government of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> on its ſide, than it made the penalty of not embracing it, the loſs of Eſtate, Liberty, and Life; and Herbs were reckoned too high a Diet, and Caves and Deſarts too good a Dwelling for thoſe that left all, and fled to them, to preſerve a good Conſcience. Secondly, That their denying the Cup in the Sacrament to the Laity, and the validity of the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Ordinations, and not their believing that there were Two Natures in Chriſt, were among the chief cauſes of the <hi>Habaſſins</hi> having ſuch an Averſion for Popery. Laſtly, That Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry owed all the footing that it ever had in <hi>Ethiopia</hi> to Violence; ſo that it no ſooner loſt the aſſiſtance of the Secular Arm, than it came to nothing. There are two paſſages likewiſe in this Letter, which do ſeem to make it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:57883:219"/>That the <hi>Habaſſins</hi> do not believe Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation; the one is, where they do abſolutely deny our Saviour's Blood to be in the Element of Bread; and the other is, where they ſeem to intimate, That our Saviour made his Diſciples underſtand what he meant, by calling the Bread and Wine in the Sacrament, his Body and Blood, by bidding them Celebrate it <hi>in Memory of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Patriarch finding that there was no remedy but that he muſt go to <hi>Fremona,</hi> and that the Emperor would neither lend him his own Arms, nor appoint him a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Guard, did thereupon deſire him to charge ſome Reſponſible Man with the Books and every thing elſe that belonged to the Church; declaring that if that was not done, That he would not take them with him: The Anſwer the Emperor returned to this petition was very ſhort, which was, <hi>That for his part, he did not know how to pack Goods, and that he muſt therefore e'en do it himſelf, and having done it, be gone with them.</hi> And the Patriarch having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to know who it was that was to be his Convoy; he had word ſent him on <hi>Holy Thurſday,</hi> That they were two Meſſengers, and two Nobles, who would go well attended with Servants, and that he muſt begin his Journey next Morning; which being come, the Patriarch made his Farewel-Sermon; and after that was ended,

You do affirm likewiſe, that water ſqueezed from dry grapes may be Conſecrated, and that the Souls of Children are derived from their Parents, with a great many other things that are repugnant to the holy Scriptures, and have been Condemned and Anathematized in divers Councils.</hi>

<pb n="416" facs="tcp:57883:221"/>as upon that of</hi> Aaron, <hi>on the day of my Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, command you neither by force nor promiſes to endeavour to oblige the</hi> Portugueſes <hi>that ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main here to renounce the true</hi> Roman <hi>Faith: Nor to ſet any Captain over them that is not a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick by Deſcent, and choſen by Catholicks. And I do pronounce the greater Excommunication to be</hi> Ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo facto <hi>incurred, and do invocate the Indignation and Curſe of Almighty God, and of the holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, St.</hi> Peter <hi>and St.</hi> Paul, <hi>and of St.</hi> Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, <hi>the Patron of</hi> India, <hi>and of St.</hi> James <hi>the Great, the Patron of</hi> Spain <hi>and</hi> Portugal, <hi>on all that ſhall any ways offend in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or who ſhall at any time forſake the</hi> Roman <hi>Faith.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>In the Fifth place, I do advertiſe your Highneſs, and all and every one in your Empire, that there is no Nation under Heaven that has the like Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to another, as</hi> Ethiopia <hi>has to</hi> Portugal. <hi>The</hi> Portugueſes <hi>not having come among you, as the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>went into</hi> Egypt <hi>with Aſſes, to have them laden with Proviſions to ſatisfy their hunger; but were moved to it purely out of Charity and Zeal for the faith. It is not above an Hundred years ſince they were ſent by their King to his great coſt laden with Arms and Muskets, and accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with a train of Artillery which is at this time in your Camp, with the Royal Arms of</hi> Portugal <hi>upon them, with their Pockets full of Money, and that not to make themſelves Maſters of</hi> Ethiopia, <hi>nor to Conquer it for their King, but to deliver the</hi> Habaſſins <hi>out of a</hi> Mahometan <hi>Captivity, and to free them from the Yoke which that curſed Sect had laid upon their necks; for which great Service,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:57883:221"/>they have been ſo ill rewarded, that their Children and Grandchildren were reduced to that Penury, that the King of</hi> Portugal <hi>was obliged to allow them a yearly Maintenance. Wherefore I do beſeech your Highneſs, to let them enjoy the Privileges which their Fathers purchaſed for them with their Blood; and which have been granted them by former Kings for their ſervices.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the Sixth place, I would have your Highneſs remember, that ſeveral of the Fathers of the Society who are Eminent for their Piety and Learning, have come into</hi> Ethiopia <hi>at divers times, not to ſeek after Honours or Riches, but to ſerve God and your people in much humility; and to teach them the true faith, ſome of them having given the greateſt Teſtimonies of love that are poſſible, in having laid down their Lives for their Friends; which Three of them did, one after having been ſeveral years a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner at</hi> Matzua, <hi>and the other two at</hi> Adel; <hi>and thoſe that are now alive have ſerved your Father with all the fidelity of Doctors, Servants, and Slaves, as he himſelf has many times told me; all which notwithſtanding, after they had built ſeveral Churches and Houſes, they are now turned out of them all; and that in the midſt of Winter their Churches and Goods being all given to the Enemies of the</hi> Roman <hi>Faith; the Fathers that were at</hi> Gorgora <hi>having in little more than three Months time been ſent from three ſeveral places; they that were at</hi> Dembea <hi>and</hi> Gojam <hi>having been likewiſe turned out of all; notwithſtanding all which hard uſage, they continue to pray to God to Eſtabliſh your Highneſs's Empire for ever; and that he would give you a Houſe that has the true faith for its Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:57883:222"/>and Heaven for its Roof. Furthermore I would have your Highneſs remember, That your Father deſired the Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>to ſend a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch and Biſhops into</hi> Ethiopia; <hi>at whoſe requeſt he ſent me and a Biſhop; we were both Maſters of Divinity, and Readers of the holy Scriptures: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did the moſt Catholick Powerful and Munifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent King of</hi> Portugal, <hi>expect that your Father ſhould have remitted Gold to him to defray the charges of our Miſſion, or that he ſhould have taxed his Nobles on that account; but he took the whole charge thereof upon himſelf, which amounted to ſeveral Thouſand Oquea's giving us alſo many rich pieces to make Preſents of, ſome of which are at this time in your Royal Palace, and in ſeveral great Houſes in</hi> Ethiopia: <hi>Neither did he ſo much as charge your Father with the Maintenance of our perſons, having ſent me yearly an Hundred Oquea's to ſupport my Dignity. Now all the return you have made to your Brother the King of</hi> Portugal, <hi>and to the Biſhop and me for all the charge and trouble that we have been at, is to throw us out of all at a blow, and to entertain another without knowing who he is, or from whence he comes; threatening us like Caterpillars, againſt whom when they come, the whole Countrey is up in Arms; ſo that according to the word of</hi> David, I am caſt out like a locuſt; <hi>you, in what you do, fulfilling what Chriſt ſaid to the</hi> Jews, I came in my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's name, and you received me not; <hi>another will come in his own name, and him you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>when they went out of</hi> Egypt <hi>carried not only their own goods, but the</hi> Egyptians <hi>alſo which they had borrowed; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we are forced to leave a great part of our own
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:57883:222"/>goods behind us; but ſince we muſt leave them all when we come to die, that gives us but little trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but what afflicts us moſt is, that your Highneſs ſhould ſend the ſame Meſſage to us, which another King delivered with his own Mouth to</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Aaron <hi>in the Twelfth of</hi> Exodus; Ariſe and go from among my people; <hi>and that with the ſame haſte as he forced the</hi> Jews <hi>out of</hi> Egypt <hi>by night, it being ſaid the</hi> Egyptians <hi>preſſed the</hi> Hebrews <hi>to depart ſuddenly, ſaying,</hi> if they do not depart this night, we are all dead men; <hi>imputing the death of their Firſt-born to the preſence and detention of the Children of</hi> Iſrael; <hi>whereas in Juſtice they ſhould have attributed it to the hatred they bore to the</hi> Hebrews, <hi>who had been their deliverers, and to their own cruelty, in having thrown their Sons into the</hi> Nile. <hi>After the ſame manner</hi> Ethiopia <hi>ought to impute the juſt puniſhments they have received at the hand of God, to the unjuſt hatred they have for the</hi> Portugueſes <hi>their reſtorers; and to their Manifold publick and ſcandalous Sins, ſome where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I ſhall juſt mention:</hi>

Their Monks care not to have any thing more of Monks than the habit, chuſing the Houſes of the Court of Ladies for their Monaſteries. The Nobles are for making themſelves Lords of the Church and her Lands, indulging the fleſh in all things, and would have their Paſtors to be as ſo many Statues, in having neither Eyes to ſee their Sins, nor Mouths to reprove them, nor hands to chaſtiſe them.</hi>

Was it by Excommunications, or by doing any thing that looked like a Miracle? No, it was by neither of thoſe methods, but it was purely by the force of the Imperial Authority: And did not the ſame hand that threw them into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſet them at liberty again?

<pb n="426" facs="tcp:57883:227"/>do not obſerve them; the faculties of the Will and Conſent being ſo in the nature of the Soul, as to Govern its animal Powers, which are the Fleſh: This is a true account of the nature of Vows.

            <p>The Patriarch, when the Meſſenger had notified him, and asked him, <hi>Whether he thought he had not been the cauſe of bloodſhed enough al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in</hi> Ethiopia?

                     <hi>Their coming at firſt into theſe Parts, though drawn hither by nothing elſe but their unſatiable covetouſneſs, and deſiring to have a Trade with us, was well enough; but to force us to it, whether we would or not; and inſtead of helping us to Goods, and Honour, to encourage us to trade with them, to fleece us to our very Souls if we did it, or refuſed it is, ſuch an Heavenly or earthly Law, as I muſt own I do not underſtand. Let us for once grant them, That we are, as they ſay, without the Knowledge of the True God; What then? Can there be any ſuch God as ſhall command us to be Robbed of our Lands, Crowns, Lives, and Liberties, and of our Wives, Children, Brethren, and Kinsfolk, that ſo we may be brought to the Knowledge of him?

<pb n="438" facs="tcp:57883:233"/>Strangers, are Injuſtices which will infallibly be puniſhed at his Divine Tribunal; for the very Men that do plunder us, do at the ſame time teach us, That when the Son of God ſent his Miniſters to Preach his new Law over the World, that one of his Inſtructions to them was, that they ſhould propoſe it to the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>and if ſome refuſed to hear them, that they ſhould go then and tender it to others: For had this work been to have been done by Viclence, their Maſter was ſufficiently able to have done one of theſe two things for his Miniſters, either to</hi> have endued them with ſuch a Divine Power as could not be reſiſted, but muſt have obliged all People to have ſurrendred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to them; or have given them Armies to have forced the World to a ſubmiſſion. <hi>Whereas it is moſt certain, that thoſe Miniſters had no order</hi> to take any thing from any body, or to compel any to receive their Doctrines: <hi>Which makes me wonder how the</hi> Portugueſes, <hi>who pretend to be ſuch</hi> Singular Miniſters of thoſe Doctrines, <hi>ſhould firſt force us by War to embrace them, and after we have embraced them, ſhould Rob us: What ſhall I call ſuch People as theſe?

<pb n="439" facs="tcp:57883:233"/>and Death. <hi>But to paſs over what is ancient, and to go no higher than my Father; Who among you, though your Bowels were neſts of Scorpions, or of worſe creatures, if there be any, do not lament the Memory of what he ſuffered at their hands, even to the taking away of his life by barbarous and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical Methods? I have a thouſand times, and a thouſand to that, viſited the Tomb of my good, but unhappy Father; and I never did it once, but I heard his blood crying to God for Juſtice, as alſo for vengeance upon my Soul; which made me conſider, how he had provoked the</hi> Portuguefes <hi>to Murther him as they did, or what I had done to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſame treatment. As to my Father, he was eaſily juſtified; and as to my ſelf, I am not ſenſible that I ever did any thing to offend them, unleſs it were by turning Chriſtian; which, though it may ſeem ſtrange, yet lively Experience aſſures us, that it is their common practice to Reſpect and Reverence us ſo long as we continue to profeſs our own Religion, and to perſecute and abominate us ſo ſoon as we are perſuaded by them to profeſs theirs. I need not tell you, that I was bred up among them at</hi> Goa, <hi>where I ſaw ſo much of their Inſolence, that I do much more wonder at their not having committed greater here, than at their having committed thoſe they have at</hi> Goa. <hi>I ſaw the</hi> King of <hi>Ormus</hi> thrown into Jayl, and his Crown taken from him and given to another, only upon a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that he was Mad; <hi>though</hi> all his Madneſs was, his having refuſed to give them as much to let him keep his Crown, as he to whom they gave it had offered for it; <hi>for with them</hi> we are Catholicks, or in our Wits, according as we give; If we give them much, <hi>though we

If their Religion teacheth them theſe things, it cannot be a good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; but if it does not, they then muſt be very Wicked to diſhonour it as they do by their innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Inſolencies; but however that is, I am certain, we have reaſon to ſeek to ſecure our necks, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to forſake their Religion as bad, or to abominate them as the worſt of men, which I will always be ſure to do, but will at the ſame time acknowledge, that were their Actions conformable to their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they would not be ill men. Nevertheleſs we have the Law of our own great Prophet to ſave us, and which of all other Laws will do it the moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually: Neither ſhall I fail to take ſevere Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on my ſelf for having forſaken it for their Law, and that without ſeeking to excuſe my ſelf, by my having been converted by them at an age when I was not capable of underſtanding their Cheat, or of foreſeeing my own ruin thereby. But this I muſt ſay in my own juſtification, That I diſcovered the error I had committed at the ſame time I came to the uſe of my reaſon; and retracted it in my heart, though till this day it was not poſſible for me to do it publickly; but though I have been ſlow in doing it, I do hope the glorious atchievements of this day will abundantly compenſate for that my ſlowneſs, being confident that our moſt juſt Prophet will obtain a pardon for me from the ſublime</hi> Ala
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:57883:234"/>
                     <hi>for my having delivered this his people from that ſhameful ſlavery they have been ſo long held in by vile</hi> Portugueſe <hi>Tyranny, called by its profeſſors the</hi> Catholick Church, <hi>whoſe miſchiefs are now legible in their ſufferings; it being God's property to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe horrible Inſolencies, and to favour regular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; ſo we ſee they are all fallen by the edge of our Swords, and the flight of our Arrows; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tied hand and foot by the enormity of their Crimes, none of them have offered to make the leaſt reſiſtance, neither have any of them eſcaped. Where was that Courage they ſo much boaſt of, and that Juſtice which they pretend favours them? By this you may all ſee plainly, that we are Superior to them, both as to a righteous Law, and in true Courage; as alſo that you were cheated by their cunning per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions, to leave the breaſts of our true Religion, wherein you had been Educated, in returning to which you ſhall have me for an example. As to thoſe who have never Apoſtatized, I have nothing to ſay to them upon this point; but what I am now about to ſay, concerns you all equally; which is, That you join together to recover your ancient Liberty, and to defend your Ancient Kingdom, reviving the glory of your forgotten Cavalry, which in former ages was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous all over the world. You now know by Experience what the</hi> Portugueſes <hi>are, who when they firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered this City, took advantage of our unwarineſs; but whereever people are watchful, there they are either beat, or depend on their craft for that, which we expect only from our Arms. Let them come now when they will, and they ſhall find what their courage or craft will ſignify to them; for as I am reſolved to believe nothing that they ſay, ſo having upon this happy day cleared this place of them, whenever they come,
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:57883:235"/>I will defend it with more vigor than I attacked it; and how ſhould they be able to retake this City, who when they had it in their poſſeſſion, were not able to keep it? Wherefore do but obſerve my Orders, and you ſhall live in honour and ſafety, and be freed from Tyranny in your Houſes.</hi>

Neither was it only the Enemies of that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, of which it never yet wanted good ſtore among the Clergy that talked thus; the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals <hi>De propaganda fide,</hi> having themſelves declared, That they had the ſame thoughts of it, by taking that Miſſion out of the hands of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Jeſuits, and committing it to <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Capuchins. Neither were the Cardinals much miſtaken in this matter; for in truth, the thing that ruined the Intereſt of Popery in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> was the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, even when they were moſt in favour with the Emperor, caballing ſtill with Princes and Governors, who were their Converts, to Canton <hi>Ethiopia</hi> into ſeveral Independent Kingdoms; together with their preſuming, that with four or five Hundred <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, they ſhould be able at any time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>Ethiopia</hi> to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, which
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:57883:237"/>conceit made them the leſs fearful of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Errors, or of precipitating things. This deſign of breaking the <hi>Habaſſin</hi> Empire into ſeveral Independent Principalities, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they might condemn it at <hi>Rome</hi> for not having ſucceeded, they could not in general condemn it either as impolitick or ſinful; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing viſible to all the World, that the great Fabrick of the Papacy was erected and eſtabliſhed by the ſame courſe; that is, by its having broke the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire into a great many Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Kingdoms; for which reaſon, the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe Kingdoms from ever conſolida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting again into one great Monarchy, is viſibly the chief care of the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> which, let the <hi>moſt Catholick,</hi> or the <hi>moſt Chriſtian,</hi> expreſs never ſo much Zeal for their Religion, immediately turns their Enemy, whenever they begin to think of being Univerſal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch.</p>
            <p>Now, though I cannot ſay, That the great <hi>Palafox,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>La Pueba de los An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geles</hi> had the miſcarriage of this Miſſion in his eye, when he called upon <hi>Innocent</hi> the 10th in his ſecond Letter to him, bearing date the 8th of <hi>January,</hi> 1649. to <hi>weigh the Services and Diſſervices</hi> the Jeſuit Order had done the Church in an equal Ballance; nevertheleſs, conſidering how the Fathers by caballing with Princes, and plunging themſelves over head and ears into Politicks in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> did, as it were, in one day deſtroy all the Effects of their long and great Labours in that Empire, what that Learned and Pious Prelate has ſaid, is ſo very pat on this occaſion, that I ſhall lay it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Reader.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="448" facs="tcp:57883:238"/>
            <p>As I do voluntary confeſs, <hi>ſaith</hi> Palafox, <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the middle of the Letter,</hi> That the Jeſuits have by their Virtues, no leſs than their Writings, and both by their Words and Examples, done great Service and Honour to the Church of God; ſo I do aſſure your Holineſs, that by ſome troubleſome Qualities, not to ſpeak of Defects which belong to them, they have done the Church more harm than good; it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your Holineſs's buſineſs to weigh the one againſt the other in your Apoſtolical Balance, to ſee which does preponderate. For, as a Prebend or Benefice is unprofitable to him that injoys it, when its Charges exceed its Revenue; ſo a Religious Order may be ſaid to be prejudicial to the Church, when it brings more damage than profit to it; and eſpecially, when there are other Orders and Ecclefiaſticks, who may be as ſerviceable to the Church, without being prejudicial to her.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe all the Jeſuits to labour hard in the Service of the Church, yet what do all their labours ſignify, if they themſelves deſtroy all the effects of them, or make them groan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the feet of the Grandure and Authority they have uſurped to themſelves? What ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage can a Biſhop derive from their Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, if they diſhonour and perſecute him, whenever he does any thing that they do not like? What fruit can the People reap by their Inſtructions, if they raiſe Troubles and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions among them? Of what advantage is it to Parents to have their Children taught by them, if they rob them of their ſweet Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:57883:238"/>by taking their Children from them, and afterwards throwing them many times off ſhamefully for trivial reaſons? Furthermore, What advantage have Miniſters of State, Grandees and Princes, by being ſometimes well-ſerved by them in their Courts, if the greater part of them are ſo far from being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged by neceſſity, in ſuch Affairs, that they intrude themſelves into them of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with a Preſumption, which is prejudicial to the State, and does very much diminiſh that eſteem Spiritual Miniſters ought to be had in, rendering themſelves thereby odious to the Laity, by entering into all the Intrigues and Secrets of Families, which they pretend to govern no leſs than the Maſters thereof; and all this under the colour of the Spiritual Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of their Conſciences, tumbling no leſs ſcandalouſly than perniciouſly from Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual to Politick Matters, from Politick to Prophane, and from Prophane to Criminal.</p>
            <p>What does it ſignify, that the Jeſuit is more flouriſhing than any of the other Orders, if out of a ſecret jealouſy, it darkens and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes all its Credit, and all its Power, Riches, Learning, and Pens, by publiſhing Books that do it? And what is the Church profited by its Books, if at the ſame time ſhe is diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the many dangerous Opinions intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by its Fryars, who have transformed, if not deſtroy'd the Wiſdom which is truly Chriſtian, and have rendred the truth of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity it ſelf doubtful. What the Apoſtle teacheth being certainly true, which is, That the Knowledge of thoſe who will learn things
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:57883:239"/>which do not belong to them, is deſtructive. Which leſſon ought to teach both them and us, not to ſeek after a Knowledge that will not be governed by Charity. <hi>In a word,</hi> If it pleaſe your Holineſs, what other Religious Order has ever been ſo prejudicial as this to the Catholick Church, or has filled all Chriſtian Countrys with ſo great Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</p>
            <p>The Cardinals <hi>De propaganda fide,</hi> being reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, it ſeems, That neither the <hi>Portuguſe</hi> Jeſuits nor Government ſhould have any thing more to do with the Converſion of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> named ſix <hi>French</hi> Capuchins to go thither;

            </p>
            <p>The Emperor finding the Peaſants were not to be <hi>undeceived,</hi> ordered the Viceroy of <hi>Tigre</hi> to march againſt them with a numerous Army, who having brought them to a Battel, routed them totally; and their Head, <hi>Za Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam,</hi> being taken the day after the Fight, was cut in pieces by the Soldiers, who were

            <p>In the year 1648.
<note place="margin">Father <hi>Torquato</hi> is ſent by the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch to <hi>Suaqhem</hi> for to bring him Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</note> the Patriarch, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſtill at <hi>Goa,</hi> ſufficiently mortified by the Congregation <hi>de Propaganda fide</hi> reflecting ſo much upon his Conduct, as to take the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Church out of the hands both of his Order and Countrey, notwithſtanding he had complied ſo far with what was ordered at <hi>Rome,</hi> as not to ſend a <hi>Portugueſe;</hi> yet he ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to ſend an <hi>Italian</hi> Jeſuit to <hi>Suaqhem</hi> to try if he could get into <hi>Ethiopia</hi> to ſend him intelligence how matters ſtood there.</p>
            <p>Father <hi>Torquato,</hi> which was the Jeſuit's name that was ſent, having put himſelf into the habit of a Merchant, embarked upon an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Ship at <hi>Surat</hi> that was bound for <hi>Suaqhem,</hi> which having touched at <hi>Moqha;</hi> the Father, who was ſent to <hi>Ethiopia</hi> chiefly for Intelligence, pretended to meet with the News there, of <hi>Baſilides</hi> having declared himſelf a <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> and of his having ſent into <hi>Arabia</hi> for
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:57883:242"/>Prieſts of that Sect to come and inſtruct his people therein.</p>
            <p>This News put Father <hi>Torquato</hi> into ſuch a paſſion, that he reſolved without uſing any precautions,
<note place="margin">Father <hi>Torquate</hi> meets with the News at <hi>Moqua,</hi> of <hi>Baſilides</hi> being turned <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.</hi>
               </note> to run preſently into <hi>Ethiopia</hi> to confound thoſe <hi>Infidel</hi> Prieſts, before they had time to ſpread their contagion there. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the wrong ſide of the Sea, and fearing that he had not Faith enough to croſs <hi>it upon his Coat, as many a Friar had done a greater Sea, and when they had not half ſo much buſineſs;</hi> he reſolved when he came to <hi>Matzua,</hi> to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by Father <hi>Anthony,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin, whom he expected to have found there, as to his going on that Errand. But whether there were any colour at that time for this ſtory of <hi>Baſilides</hi> being about to turn <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> if he was not turned already; it is no news for Monks and Friars to throw ſuch ſcandals on Princes that have any ways vexed them; witneſs their ſtories of the <hi>Iconaclaſts</hi> Emperors being ſometime turned <hi>Jews,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Mahometans;</hi> and of our King <hi>John</hi> having offered the Emperor of <hi>Morocco,</hi> if he would aſſiſt him, to be of his Religion; and of <hi>Charles Martel</hi>'s Soul being ſome years after his Death ſeen in Hell for his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilege.</p>
            <p>On the 6th. of <hi>May,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship the Father was on Board, ſailed from <hi>Moqua,</hi> and on the 12th. touched at <hi>Dela,</hi> the biggeſt Iſland in the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> it being Twelve Leagues in Length, from whence they ſailed directly to <hi>Suaqhem;</hi> where being come to an Anchor, the Maſter ſent aſhoar <hi>for pratick,</hi>
               <pb n="458" facs="tcp:57883:243"/>which he had ſent to him at firſt word, with a Preſent of freſh Proviſions from the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. The Father, who walked upon the Deck as if he had been the <hi>Supercargo,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving enquired of the Watermen that came aboard, <hi>How the Chriſtians that were in</hi> Suaqhem <hi>did?</hi>
               <note place="margin">At <hi>Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qhem</hi> he hears of the three Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chins ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered.</note> They made Anſwer, <hi>That they knew of none that were there; ſome that were there former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being gone into</hi> Ethiopia. Next day the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther went aſhoar with the Maſter to enquire farther about the Friars, but was not able to learn any thing concerning them, only he was told by ſome of the <hi>Baneans, That the Fathers that were there had been for ſome time dead:</hi> But the Maſter of the Ship having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that the Father was much troubled that he could learn nothing of his Brethren, told him, <hi>He needed not enquire any farther after them, for he could aſſure him they had been all Three Murthered by the Order of the Baſhaw;</hi> which was afterwards confirmed to him by a <hi>Banean,</hi> who told him farther, <hi>That the Baſhaw had ſtrictly forbid all People to ſpeak of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Father being now ſatisfied that the Friars were all Murthered, his next buſineſs was to get their Bodies, or ſome part of them at leaſt, to carry with him to <hi>Goa;</hi> which, with the <hi>ſtory</hi> of <hi>Baſilides being turned</hi> Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan, he reckoned would make him wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come there; but here he was at a greater loſs than he was before, conſidering the <hi>hatred,</hi> ſay the Jeſuits, <hi>that the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Hereticks have for all Sacred Relicks;</hi> nevertheleſs, being reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to carry ſomething home beſides his <hi>Moqha News,</hi> for I do not find that it was confirmed
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:57883:243"/>at <hi>Suaqhem,</hi> he ventured to ſpeak to an <hi>Engliſh Sailer,</hi> the Maſter having forbid him to go any more aſhoar, for fear of bringing the Ship in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to trouble, to go to a certain Iſland, that lay but a little way off, and if he found any dead bodies there, to bring them to him, promiſing to pay him well for his pains; the honeſt Sailer told him <hi>he would do his beſt,</hi> and going aſhoar <hi>he picked up Two Skulls and a Bone,</hi> and having brought them privately aboard, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them to the Father; who, though he had never ſeen any of the Friars, <hi>knew the Skulls at firſt ſight to be the Heads of the Two</hi> Italians <hi>that came laſt;</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate in finding the Skulls of the two <hi>Italian</hi> Friars, and a Bone of the <hi>French.</hi>
               </note> and which was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as difficult, he knew the Bone to be the Bone of Father <hi>Antony's right Arm;</hi> which was as lucky as could be, for had it happened to have belonged to either of the Skulls, which were both viſibly <hi>Italian,</hi> he muſt then have either ſent his Sailer aſhoar again to have busked for more Bones, which was not to be done without danger, or which would have been a ſad thing, he muſt have gone home without a Relick of the <hi>French</hi> Friar.</p>
            <p>With this rich Treaſure, and his <hi>Moqha</hi> News, Father <hi>Torquato</hi> returned well ſatisfied to <hi>Goa,</hi> where he was made welcome by the Patriarch, and was reckoned by all, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Capuchins of that City, to have made a good coaſting Voyage. The Patriarch having paid his devotion to the Relicks, did, contrary to the cuſtom of his Order, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Capuchins in their New Miſſion, part with this noble Treaſure to them, but upon condition, that if the Congregation <hi>de
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:57883:244"/>Propaganda fide</hi> ſhould at any time demand what Evidences they had of their being true,
<note place="margin">The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch is ſo kind as to give theſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puchins of <hi>Goa.</hi>
               </note> that they ſhould remit an exact information thereof to it. The Patriarch hoping, it is like, by this means to ſatisfie the Congregation, that the Jeſuits, for all their having repreſented the Capuchin Conduct in the <hi>Habaſſin</hi> Miſſion to have been one continued blunder, were ſo far from their being diſpleaſed with their being ſolely employed therein, that they hazarded their lives to help them to the Relicks of their Martyr'd Brethren.</p>
            <p>I have not been able to learn, whether the abovenamed Congregation did ever give it ſelf the trouble of enquiring into the truth of theſe reliques; but moſt certain it is, that if it did, that their want of natural Evidences was abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſupply'd by ſuch as were Miraculous; for they having been, as all new-found reliques are, undoubtedly much prayed to, if Ten out of a Thouſand that pray'd to them when they were ſick did but happen to recover, there were juſt ſo many ſubſtantial Witneſſes of their having a Miraculous Virtue in them to demonſtrate them to be true; and for the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Nine hundred and ninety that died, their unſucceſsful Prayers were never heard of to confront the Teſtimony of Ten living Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and being thus atteſted, the Congregation could not have deni'd them its Approbation, ſuch Teſtimonies as theſe being all the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has for the greateſt part of her Sacred Reliques: Neither would its having been afterwards diſcovered, as it was, that the Heads of thoſe Three Friars
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:57883:244"/>were ſent by the <hi>Baſhaw</hi> who cut them off, as a Preſent to the Emperor of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> have been any argument at all againſt the truth of thoſe which were lodged at <hi>Goa,</hi> there being nothing more common in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> than to have the ſame individual Reliques, and eſpecially Heads, at the ſame time in ſeveral Countries, and all of them working Miracles in Confirmation of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing genuin.</p>
            <p>The Patriarch that he might not lie at <hi>Goa,</hi> doing nothing for his Title of <hi>Illuſtriſſimo,</hi> in the Year 1650, ſent a <hi>Banean</hi> and an <hi>Habaſſin,</hi>

            <head>A SHORT ACCOUNT OF THE <hi>Dominican Hiſtory of</hi> Ethiopia.</head>
            <q>Compoſed by Father <hi>Lewis De Uuretta,</hi> a Dominican; and Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Valentia</hi> in the Year 1610.</q>
            <p>IN the Year 1316, Eight Dominican Friars, with a Holy Siſter, <hi>Santer'd</hi> from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where having Viſited the Holy Sepulcher, taking <hi>Bethlehem</hi> in their way, they went down into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Ethiopia;</hi> and having there Learned the Language of the Countrey per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly in a few days, they begun to preach to the Aſtoniſhment of that whole Empire, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the truth of all they taught by Miracles. Preſter <hi>John</hi> the Emperor hearing of thoſe wonderful Preachers, ſent to bid them welcome into his Empire, and to let them know they had free liberty to build Convents enough
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:57883:250"/>therein to hold all <hi>Europe,</hi> and to exerciſe their power of <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> upon all his Subjects; and that he would allow them all the ſame Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges and Immunities that they enjoy in the <hi>Latin</hi> Church. The Fathers overjoy'd at this news, begun preſently to make uſe of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty that was granted them; and having pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrated Six Hundred Leagues into <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> they came at laſt to the Lake of <hi>Cafates,</hi> on the other ſide of the <hi>Equinoctial,</hi> where the head of the River <hi>Nile</hi> riſeth, where upon the Mountains of the Moon, and in the Kingdom of <hi>Gojam,</hi> and among the <hi>Caffres,</hi> and in the Provinces bordering on the Cape of <hi>Goodhope,</hi> they built ſeveral Convents, filling them all preſently with Friars of their own Order, moſt of which came afterwards to be as famous for their Learning and Piety as they were for their Miracles; but the topping man of all thoſe Novices was one <hi>Tecla Haymonot,</hi> the only Child of King <hi>Sacaſab,</hi> and Queen <hi>Sarah;</hi> who having wrought divers Miracles in his Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, when he came to be a Man preferred the Dominican habit to a Crown, and came af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to be the Chief Glory of his Order, having had the Honour done him, whenever he ſaid <hi>Maſs,</hi> to have the Wafer and the Wine brought down from Heaven to him by an Angel; and whenever he went to any City to Preach, he was conſtantly attended by all the Lyons, Tygers, Wolves, Snakes, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents in the Neighbourhood, who never left him till he diſmiſſed them with the bleſſing; for which they all expreſſed themſelves very thankful; and who having founded a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:57883:250"/>for <hi>Nine thouſand Dominican Friars,</hi> obliged <hi>the Devil</hi> to do all the ſervile work thereof for Seven Years; which he did alone ſo exactly, that the Convent has never been ſo well ſerved ſince, which made an Emperor when he was told of it ſay, That <hi>Tecla Hamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not was to blame, for not having made the Devil ſerve the Convent as long as it ſtood.</hi> While the Friars were thus employed, the <hi>Holy Siſter</hi> was not idle, who as if ſhe had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have taken the Emperor at his word, built a Monaſtery, wherein ſhe placed Five Hundred Dominican <hi>Benta's</hi> of the third Rule. This great Nunnery was at firſt called <hi>Bado Nagh,</hi> but at this time <hi>Santa Clara;</hi> the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of all which Convents is to this day curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly Painted in the Cloiſters of the <hi>Plurima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos,</hi> whither any, who are ſo unreaſonable as to doubt of the truth of them, may go and be ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>The Monaſtery of <hi>Plurimanos,</hi> in which there are Nine thouſand Dominican Friars, was founded by <hi>Tecla Haymonot;</hi> It is four Leagues in Compaſs, and hath Eighty Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitories, which have all the great Church at one end, and the Refectory at the other. Some of theſe Dormitories have One hundred and twenty, ſome One hundred and fifty, and ſome Two hundred Cells. Every Dormitory has a particular Chappel and Library belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it. The great Church is Six hundred paces long, and ſo it had need, ſince all the Friars repair to it together on Sundays and Holidays. The Second great Dominican Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> is that of the <hi>Allelujah,</hi> which
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:57883:251"/>was built by <hi>Bartholomew de Tiroli,</hi> a Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Friar, who was Conſecrated Biſhop of the City of <hi>Dangola</hi> at <hi>Rome;</hi> it has but Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thouſand Friars, who on high Days Dine all together in the Refectory.</p>
            <p>From theſe two Convents, there are vaſt numbers of Miſſionaries ſent once a year to <hi>Arabia, Bengala, Siam, Pegu</hi> and <hi>China;</hi> as alſo to <hi>Congo, Monopatata,</hi> and the Cape of <hi>Goodhope,</hi> by ſome of which Miſſionaries the King of <hi>Congo</hi> and <hi>Angola,</hi> was Baptized in the Year 1580. Theſe Miſſionaries do all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home at <hi>Whitſuntide;</hi> and our Hiſtorian being ſenſible that that was more than fleſh and blood could well do, very diſcreetly prevents the objection, by telling us they came back nothing but Skin and Bone.</p>
            <p>Theſe two Monaſteries have been the greateſt Seminaries of Martyrs that have ever been in the world, above Three hundred thouſand of their Friars having ſuffered Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom in ſeveral parts, which is more than any other Order beſides the Dominicans can boaſt of. For in the Empreſs <hi>Helena</hi>'s time, who was her ſelf a Dominican <hi>Beata,</hi> Eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Friars of the <hi>Alelujah</hi> alone ſuffered death in ſeveral Provinces for preaching the Goſpel; at which the good <hi>Beata</hi> was ſo much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, that ſhe ſent to all the Mahometan and Heathen Merchants that were within her Empire, to let them know that they ſhould Trade no longer in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> if they did not take more care to preſerve her Friars lives in their Miſſions.</p>
            <pb n="471" facs="tcp:57883:251"/>
            <p>The Priors of theſe two Convents are by the Pope's Letter Conſtituted the <hi>chief Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> where the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> is more rigorous than in <hi>Spain;</hi> for it relaxeth all Hereticks and Apoſtates to the Secular Arm for their firſt fault, though never ſo penitent; who being relaxed, are always thrown, without mercy, to the Lyons.</p>
            <p>But the wonder of the world is the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's Library founded by Queen <hi>Saba,</hi> upon the Mountain of <hi>Amara,</hi> where the Convent of the <hi>holy Croſs</hi> ſtands; its Foundreſs hand-ſelled it with <hi>Solomon</hi>'s own Works, and the other Books he Preſented her withal, among which are the Books of <hi>Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Job,</hi> &amp;c. And the Emperors have been ever ſince buying all the Books they could hear of to put into it; ſo that at preſent it contains above a Million of Books all very fairly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and richly Bound, an hundred and Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand of which are <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick:</hi> Neither is there any Book whoſe loſs is bewailed here in <hi>Europe,</hi> but what is to be met with there; of which <hi>Gregory</hi> the Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth being informed, he ſent <hi>Antonio Grico</hi> and <hi>Lorenco Cremones</hi> into <hi>Ethiopia</hi> to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Library was ſo great and rich as it was reported to be; who having ſeen it, found it much greater than Fame had made it; and returning home, brought the <hi>Talmud</hi> and <hi>Cabala</hi> with them to compare them with thoſe the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Italy</hi> had in their hands. It is not very well ſtored with <hi>Latin</hi> Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Authors, having none of the Ancients, beſide St. <hi>Hierom</hi> and Saint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> tranſlated
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:57883:252"/>into <hi>Greek,</hi> and St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> tranſlated into <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick;</hi> and of the Moderns, only <hi>Thomas Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,</hi> St. <hi>Antonio,</hi> the Directory of the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and <hi>Lewis de Granada,</hi> who were all Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans; and if our Author ſent them his Hiſtory, the <hi>Librarians,</hi> who are Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, if they did not give it one of the beſt places in their <hi>Library,</hi> were very unjuſt to him; ſince if it had not been for him, their <hi>Library,</hi> in all probability, had never been heard of in <hi>Europe;</hi> the two <hi>unworthy men</hi> who had been ſent to viſit it by <hi>Gregory</hi> the XIIIth. having made no noiſe at all of it when they returned. The Key of this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary, as of the Richeſt Treaſure in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> is always put into the Emperor's hand when he is Crowned, who delivers it to the Abbot of the Monaſtery of <hi>Sancta Cruz,</hi> with a ſtrict charge to look carefully after it as the chief Jewel of his Empire.</p>
            <p>The Emperor's Treaſury, which may very well be reckoned the ſecond, if not the firſt Wonder of the World, is upon the ſame Mountain, into which ever ſince Queen <hi>Sheba</hi>'s time, they have been amaſſing vaſt quantities of Gold and Silver, and Precious Stones, without having at any time ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken one Farthing out; ſo that if the whole world were to be ſold, there is more Money in this Treaſury than would buy the Fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimple of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ethiopia</hi> has but Twelve Archbiſhops and Seventy two Biſhops; which ſmall number conſidering the vaſtneſs of the Empire, they cannot be perſuaded to increaſe, becauſe it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:57883:252"/>that of the Twelve Apoſtles, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty two Diſciples; ſo in all their Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drals likewiſe, they have never more nor few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than a Dean and Twelve Canons, who do all live in Community with their Biſhop, who has the whole Tithes of his Dioceſs; when a Canon dies, he is ſucceeded by the Eldeſt Prieſt of the Dioceſs, and the Biſhop when he dies, by the Eldeſt Canon, and the Archbiſhop by the Eldeſt Biſhop of the Province; the Eldeſt Archbiſhop is always the <hi>Pope's Legat,</hi> that Office having been annexed to that Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity by <hi>Clement</hi> the VIIth. Beſides theſe they have a great number of Titular Archbiſhops and Biſhops, who are all named by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, Empow'red thereunto by ſeveral Popes Briefs. The Archbiſhops and Biſhops viſit their whole Provinces every Sixth year, whoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communications are ſo formidable, that none can deſpiſe them longer than they can faſt, ſuch as are Excommunicated not being ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to eat or drink any thing before they have made their ſubmiſſion.</p>
            <p>Their Churches, namely that of the <hi>Allelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah,</hi> which was built by Queen <hi>Sheba</hi> in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple, in form of a Croſs, and is now Dedicated to St. <hi>Humphrey;</hi> and that which was built by Queen <hi>Candace</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles, and Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by her to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> are exceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Rich and Magnificent, ſome of them ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Three, ſome Five Naves, and all richly adorned with various Pictures and precious Stones, but chiefly Granata's.</p>
            <pb n="474" facs="tcp:57883:253"/>
            <p>As to the Doctrine of the <hi>Habaſſin</hi> Church, in all matters of Faith they are and were ever, or at leaſt ſince the time that the Eight Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nican Friars went among them, the very ſame with thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> all that has been reported within theſe Two hundred years by the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and <hi>Portugueſes</hi> of their being Hereticks, being notoriouſly falſe.</p>
            <p>The occaſion of which falſe Reports was as followeth:</p>
            <p>Moſt of the Four hundred <hi>Portugueſes</hi> who went into <hi>Ethiopia</hi> with <hi>Gama,</hi> being <hi>Jews</hi> in their hearts, were not long there before ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining themſelves to be out of the reach of the Inquiſition, they openly profeſſed Judaiſm, to the great ſcandal of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Nation, but they quickly found themſelves deceived; for the <hi>Dominican Inquiſitors</hi> having heard of this <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> did with great ſecrecy order them all to be apprehended by their <hi>Familiars;</hi> but the <hi>Jews</hi> having their <hi>Familiars</hi> too, our Author upon this occaſion affirming the whole race of them to <hi>be all Magicians, and in Confederacy with the Devil,</hi> made their eſcape before the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> or its <hi>Familiars</hi> could lay their hands on them, ſome of them running into the Kingdom of <hi>Berno;</hi> where notwithſtanding they taught the Natives how to make Gunpowder; it had been well that they had all gone, for then there would have been none left to have run to <hi>Goa,</hi> to have raiſed ſuch lyes of the <hi>Habaſſins,</hi> as thoſe who went thither did, who purely to juſtify themſelves, and to be revenged on the

<pb n="483" facs="tcp:57883:259"/>a Gaſh that reſembled a Wound made with a Spear, and on her Hands and Feet the Wounds were of a Triangular Figure, as if made by a Nail; and in order to excite the Devotion of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent as well as preſent, the <hi>Rags</hi> ſhe laid to the Wounds on <hi>Thurſdays,</hi> had always the <hi>Five Wounds of Chriſt</hi> printed on them in the form of a Croſs; and happy was the Roman Catholick Prince or Princeſs who could obtain ſome of thoſe Sacred Rags.

            <p>The Inquiſition, whoſe buſineſs it is to enquire ſeverely into the truth of things which are reported to be Miracles, having ſummoned her Confeſſor, and all the reſt
